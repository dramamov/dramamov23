[Blood River]

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.980
[Based on the novel of the same name from Zhou Munan's Youth in Jianghu series]

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.980
[Available on fanqienovel.com & bkneng.com]

[Episode 31]

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.380
We will help Your Highness

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.770
wipe their power from the realm.

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.490
That's our offer.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.570
I wonder

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.490
if it's enough for you.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.690
Tang Linghuang is our...

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.980
friend.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.980
He's also Lianyue's senior.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:05.260
Naturally,

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.290
his life matters greatly to us.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.850
If you can help us

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.170
rescue him,

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.170
and purge the puppet poison in him,

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.820
we'll owe you a great favor.

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.450
As for what you said,

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.940
borrowing my light

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.730
to light Blood River's path...

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.540
it's an honor

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.170
for me.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.170
I believe

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.450
you can bring the jianghu

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.220
a brand-new

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:52.340
Blood River.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.500
Not bad.

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.130
That's a decent ending.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.220
This isn't the end.

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:07.730
It's only the beginning.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.220
When Blood River is finally accepted

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.100
by the world,

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.060
Master Mu,

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:13.940
what's the first thing you want to do?

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.890
What I want most...

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.820
The first thing

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:22.340
is to pass the headship

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:23.340
to Yumo.

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.410
The first thing

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.730
is to hand it off?

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.060
My duty

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.980
is to lead the Mu family

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.260
into the light.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:33.380
Clearly,

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:34.450
I've done that.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.130
As for

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.660
the road ahead,

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:38.980
that's for them to decide.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.340
My second thing

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.060
is to go to Wangchengshan Sect.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.820
I'll meet

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.540
the Profound Sword Deity I admire most.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.980
And I'll eat

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.570
a peach he planted himself.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.010
Then...

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.060
stay at Mount Wangcheng to cultivate?

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.100
I did think so once,

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.980
but...

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.820
probably not.

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:06.890
Why not?

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.100
Because cultivation demands cutting off love,

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:10.570
and I can't.

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.340
My third thing

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.380
is to tell Xuewei...

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:18.700
I like her,

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:21.540
and...

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.140
I've liked her for many years.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:30.730
The previous generation of the Mu family

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.020
in Blood River

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.850
were terrors that made people quake.

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:35.700
So how come your lot

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.580
think only of romance?

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.810
Sir,

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.410
why are your hands so cold?

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.730
When did you learn the Frost Palm?

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:51.500
I didn't.

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:56.250
Changhe...

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:07.050
Let's head back to the Clinic.

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:16.490
Master,

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:17.810
are you sure

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.810
this tonic won't overwhelm

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.540
Changhe's body?

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.100
It's way too tonifying.

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.100
It's all blazing yang herbs.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:27.250
No matter.

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:29.410
Su Changhe can take it.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.700
Okay.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:54.610
You're burning, then freezing.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:55.810
How is this possible?

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.170
What's this?

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:06.370
Changhe,

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.660
my master told you to drink this.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:12.250
I'm not drinking it.

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.100
Does this look fit for a human to drink?

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:17.370
I tasted it.

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:18.580
It looks black

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:19.460
but tastes sweet.

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:45.490
Without that medicine,

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.730
you'll sleep an hour

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:48.930
and wake freezing,

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:50.580
another hour

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:51.780
and wake burning.

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:53.540
Then you won't sleep again,

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:55.170
because you'll feel

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.020
ants crawling all over you.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.660
Mighty Patriarch of Blood River

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.340
ever suffered like that?

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:05.780
Feels like being thrown back into the Furnace.

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:10.290
The Prince of Langya

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:12.340
is off.

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:14.140
Maybe...

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.490
he cultivates an extreme-cold style?

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.050
That palm you took earlier

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:21.290
hurt you with Frost Qi.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:22.900
His skills aren't weak.

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:24.850
But if his palm could hurt me this bad,

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:25.850
what right do we have

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:26.700
to bargain with him?

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:28.660
My Hell Palm

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.340
draws in the opponent's Qi

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:31.540
in a clash of palms,

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:32.540
and strikes it back.

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.020
So the stronger the foe, the harder it hits.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.900
But the Prince of Langya's Qi

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:38.580
carries poison.

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:40.370
What kind of poison?

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:42.220
It's frost poison.

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:43.370
That's right.

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:44.900
It's frost poison.

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:46.460
If it were Frost Qi alone,

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:48.370
I'd just absorb it and strike it back.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:50.460
But the frost poison is tricky.

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:52.540
With one palmful I drew in,

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:54.540
it started rampaging

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:55.490
all through my body.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:58.660
He poisoned you?

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:00.220
No, he didn't.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.100
The moment he came in,

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:03.170
I sensed something off

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:04.140
in his look.

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:05.930
He was invaded by frost poison himself.

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:07.460
He hasn't long to live.

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.220
Oh, really?

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:11.490
But,

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.020
isn't he a prince?

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:14.540
With so many imperial physicians,

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:16.580
how is he still afflicted?

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:18.580
I heard two years ago,

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.290
he led a southern campaign.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.140
Nanjue sent

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:25.100
five martial arts grandmasters to kill him.

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:27.610
All five were cut down,

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:29.290
but one of them

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:31.660
had reached the Free-Heaven level

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:33.890
and practiced the Demonic Frost Art, Moon-Yin Finger.

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:35.300
Maybe the rumor is true.

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:37.180
No wonder

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.180
he's so desperate to work with us.

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:42.220
Seems he's cornered too.

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:44.370
Can this frost poison

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:46.220
be cured?

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:49.370
I'd need to take his pulse

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:50.820
to be sure,

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:54.610
but from how he looked earlier,

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.770
he's likely at the point

00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:58.100
of beyond remedy.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:59.530
Even if once

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:01.250
there was a chance to treat it,

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:03.300
by now

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.440
there's at best a sliver of hope.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:08.610
As a man soon to die,

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.460
what would he want from us?

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:14.010
Maybe he wants our hand

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:16.340
to purge Tianqi City

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.650
of those plotting unrest.

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:19.850
Before he dies, he wants

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.460
to clear every threat

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:23.820
for his elder brother.

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:27.100
That's his aim.

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:30.250
So noble as that?

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:33.530
If I were dying,

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:35.220
why care about tomorrow?

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:36.890
The world

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:38.340
would have nothing to do with me.

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:48.130
I'm going into seclusion.

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:51.370
Seclusion?

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.250
That frost poison nearly crippled me,

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.100
and it ties to my Hell Palm

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:56.010
at the ninth level.

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:57.980
I failed to break that threshold,

00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.730
so the backlash hit this hard.

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.420
Once I reach the ninth,

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:02.980
any frost or flame poison

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:04.460
will be easy to dispel.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:05.530
All right.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.340
Then leave to me

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:09.220
the other affairs for now.

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:13.940
Don't rush.

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:17.250
The Prince of Langya is at death's door.

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:18.700
They're the ones who should worry,

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:19.460
not us.

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.530
I'll take it back and refine medicine.

00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:03.770
This case defies a quick prescription.

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:05.610

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:32.180
Nothing.

00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:33.460
He's only asleep.

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:34.700

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:35.340

Miss!

00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:51.850
Hold on!

How is my son's illness?

His condition

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:02.460
won't be cured in a snap.

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:03.730
If it were that simple,

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:05.290
those physicians you hired

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:06.380
would've fixed him already.

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:08.090
But none of them

00:17:08.830 --> 00:17:10.730
produced this specific reaction.

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:13.220
That means their skills were lacking.

00:17:13.830 --> 00:17:14.380
However,

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:15.860
I can at least let your son

00:17:16.070 --> 00:17:17.140
sleep soundly.

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:18.420
Otherwise,

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:19.860
if that state earlier

00:17:20.070 --> 00:17:21.290
last another dozen days,

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:22.290
even if he doesn't die,

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:23.570
he'll be a living corpse.

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:24.050
Hey!

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:26.570
Sir, rest easy.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.380
Miss Bai has a plan.

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:30.220
Once the elixir is refined,

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:31.900
Mr. Li's illness

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:33.810
will naturally be cured.

00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:42.730
Cured?

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:46.180
What's going on?

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:47.770
I don't know either.

00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:50.090
The deputy commander sent men everywhere for physicians,

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:52.250
and one turned up at Blood River's clinic.

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:54.530
By the time we heard,

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:57.050
the physician was already inside.

00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:59.090
Don't let her leave.

00:17:59.310 --> 00:17:59.860
At once.

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:06.290
Can your people

guarantee this job?

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:12.010
You decide to act?

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:16.090
Let's hope those Blood River folks

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:19.530
don't disappoint me.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.220
Much obliged, Sir.

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:25.860
Guards!

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:34.620
Can you find a cure?

00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:35.660
Of course.

00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:37.220
But,

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:38.730
it'll take a few days.

00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:40.700
If that's the case,

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:42.090
please stay

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:43.660
at my manor a few days.

00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:45.010
Sir,

00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:47.290
I brought the physician here.

00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:48.810
If she wants to leave,

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:50.180
I'm taking her.

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:52.700
If you mean to keep her by force,

00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:55.420
there's only one way.

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:57.420
Which is?

00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:00.660
Kill me.

00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:06.980
You think I don't dare?

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:07.900
Never mind my title

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:09.530
as Second Master of Thousand-Gold Tower.

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:11.700
Today, I'm just Tu Wan.

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:12.900
If you want me dead,

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:15.010
go ahead and try

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:17.460
so long as you can shoulder

00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:18.250
the cost.

00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:25.620
Fine.

00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:27.730
As you wish!

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:29.730
Whether I stay or go

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:31.530
isn't for you to decide.

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:33.700
Come on!

00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:34.490
Come on!

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:35.660
All of you at once.

00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:36.860
Let's see

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:37.940
who can keep us here today.

00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:48.090
Go!

00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:54.940
Who's there?

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:01.380
You knew I'm here?

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:02.530
No.

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:03.530
I guessed.

00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:09.050
Who are you?

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:14.980
Physicians heal and save lives.

00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:16.860
All should respect them.

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:19.490
Yet you would cage one.

00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:21.420
How is that right?

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:25.490
So, you're going to kill me?

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:27.770
If I wanted you dead,

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:29.490
I could do it anytime.

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.420
But right and wrong

00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:32.860
aren't judged by might.

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:35.140
You stand in the light.

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:38.460
Treasure your power and rank.

00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:42.220
Let's go.

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:45.730
Off we go!

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:00.050
Also,

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:02.090
if you want to make trouble

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:03.250
for Second Master Tu later,

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:04.900
then next time we meet,

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:06.620
what I bring you

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:09.010
won't be just sword energy.

00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:11.010
What madman are you?

00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:12.980
Do you take Tianqi City's Jinwu Guard

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:13.940
for mere decoration?

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:16.770
You're just a swordsman.

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:19.940
You may kill one, kill ten.

00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:23.090
But if my Jinwu Guard comes by the thousand,

00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:26.010
will you survive?

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:31.180
I don't know if I will,

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:33.180
but you...

00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:37.420
will certainly die.

00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:52.330
Truly sorry.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:53.860
I thought

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:54.810
it was a chance

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:56.220
for He-Yu Clinic to make a name in Tianqi.

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:58.220
I didn't expect the Jinwu Guard's deputy commander

00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:59.620
to be this unreasonable.

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:02.730
It's fine.

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:04.490
You meant well.

00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:06.180
Miss Bai and I will head back.

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:07.570
If the deputy commander

00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:09.090
comes after you later,

00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:10.730
find us at the Clinic.

00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:13.420
Don't be afraid.

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:14.700
We've got your back.

00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:15.700
All right.

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:17.330
As for his son's illness,

00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:18.620
no need to bother, Miss.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.380
Let them fend for themselves.

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:22.900
They should taste a little hardship.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.090
I'll take my leave.

00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:26.010
Mr. Su,

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:27.660
let's go hear some tunes when you're free.

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:31.490
Farewell.

00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:40.180
That deputy commander's son

00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:40.980
isn't right.

00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:42.090
Why?

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:43.530
He bears puppet poison,

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:45.530
but unlike what we saw

00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:46.550
in Sihuai City that day.

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:47.660
This one is still alive.

00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:49.700
I have a bad feeling.

00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:51.290
Maybe Night Crow

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:52.620
is seeping her puppet poison

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:54.490
through all of Tianqi City.

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:55.900
If even here

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:57.900
a deputy commander's son is poisoned,

00:22:58.200 --> 00:22:59.250
then elsewhere

00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:00.140
others

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:00.940
may be infected too.

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:02.490
Are they trying

00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:03.420
to raise a puppet army?

00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:05.530
No wonder they've kept quiet

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:07.050
all this time.

00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:08.730
Let's return to the Clinic.

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:10.860
I took a drop of his brow-blood.

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:12.770
I'll see if I can refine

00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:13.810
an antidote early.

00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:14.620
Okay.

00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:17.420
Be careful!

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:23.940
What crushing blade aura.

00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:33.490
You're Blade Ghost Xu Liuyun.

00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:38.050
You're Umbrella Ghost Su Muyu.

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:39.490
Many years ago,

00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:41.420
we met once.

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:42.730
Yes.

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:45.940
Shame we met,

00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:47.490
yet had no chance

00:23:47.550 --> 00:23:48.770
to test each other.

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:54.220
Meeting again in Tianqi City

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:57.330
settles that regret.

00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:58.940
You want a fight with me?

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:01.010
Why?

00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:02.860
Sent by another,

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:04.620
I've waited for you here.

00:24:05.790 --> 00:24:07.250
As for the physician behind you,

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:08.700
her life

00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:10.530
will be taken here, today.

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:13.220
So the famed Blade Ghost of Nanjue

00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:15.660
let Tianqi's powers

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:16.380
use him?

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:19.660
Didn't expect that.

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:22.730
We're all just blades

00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:24.660
in others' hands.

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:26.660
Isn't Blood River the same?

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:27.900
Not anymore.

00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:29.900
We're different now.

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:32.490
Miss Bai,

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:33.900
when I clash with him,

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:35.090
find a way to slip out.

00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:36.330
I've heard

00:24:36.550 --> 00:24:37.420
of the Blade Ghost of Nanjue.

00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:39.330
They say his skill rivals a Blade Deity's,

00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:40.810
but his ways are too bizarre

00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:42.220
to be ranked one.

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:43.940
Be careful.

00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:45.330
Rest easy.

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:46.290
No problem.

00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:52.570
Since they call you Umbrella Ghost,

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.730
I'll gift you a ghost-breaker.

00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:07.180
Immortal-slayer!

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:54.380
Without your umbrella,

00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:56.220
you can't use the Eighteen-Sword Array.

00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:57.730
After all,

00:25:57.790 --> 00:25:59.290
that's your deadliest killing art.

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:01.090
My Spring-Rain Swordwork

00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:03.140
is enough to kill you.

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:08.290
I see.

00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:10.420
You want

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:12.220
to cast off those marks on you,

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:14.490
the title Umbrella Ghost,

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:17.220
the Eighteen-Sword Array...

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:18.730
Do you know

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:20.460
when a killer

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:21.700
will meet

00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:23.180
his death?

00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:24.420
It's...

00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:27.620
when his heart holds

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:29.090
more than killing!

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:56.010
Don't treat me like dead weight!

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:57.220
Now I see

00:26:57.270 --> 00:26:58.420
why you're only a Blade Ghost,

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:00.490
not a Blade Deity.

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:02.940
As long as I win,

00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:05.180
titles mean nothing!

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:10.220
Horse-Cleaver fells immortals.

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:12.140
Goose-Feather Blade slays saints.

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:14.010
Miao Sabre breaks ghosts.

00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:15.980
Precept Blade banishes Buddhas.

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:17.900
Gold-Ring Saber destroys deities.

00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:21.900
Be you immortal, Buddha, ghost, deity,

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:23.460
or the greatest sage among men,

00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:25.810
all will die beneath my blades!

00:28:04.030 --> 00:28:04.700
Fall!

00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:14.940
Su Muyu!

00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:15.900
I've laid a poison array.

00:28:16.030 --> 00:28:16.860
He won't dare get close.

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:17.570
Fight at ease.

00:28:17.790 --> 00:28:18.330
Kill him!

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:32.420
What?

00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:38.860
I know

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:40.250
why you use so many blades.

00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:42.730
You can't drive any single one

00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:44.010
to its limit.

00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:45.460
Therefore,

00:28:45.550 --> 00:28:46.660
you wield them all

00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:49.180
to mask your weakness.

00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:50.730
You're not wrong.

00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:52.810
But I'll kill you

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:54.810
before you shatter the last,

00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:56.460
Umbrella Ghost!

00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:58.810
Now that Changhe and I lead Blood River,

00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:01.900
you should address me as...

00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:05.860
Master Su.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:21.620
All right.

00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:22.940
Master Su.

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:25.180
You're worthy of the name!

00:29:47.270 --> 00:29:48.090
No one's there?

00:29:54.510 --> 00:29:55.570
You really think I'm that foolish?

00:29:58.400 --> 00:29:58.900
Miss Bai!

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:06.860
Miss Bai.

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:16.660
Master...

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:26.330
Stop the bleeding for me.

00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:30.010
At my waist,

00:30:30.030 --> 00:30:30.810
there's a green vial.

00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:31.980
Take it out.

00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:33.090
It can save my life.

00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:51.940
Don't worry.

00:30:58.830 --> 00:30:59.620
Miss Bai...

00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:16.980
Useless!

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:19.180
You wasted plenty of my Qi.

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:25.860
You didn't use your sword.

00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:27.660
With only sword aura and energy,

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:29.220
you killed my disciple at her side.

00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:31.660
Seems you care quite a lot

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:33.570
for that lady.

00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:35.290
Yet you're merciless

00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:37.900
to your disciple.

00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:41.660
She can't move now,

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:43.660
and could die any moment.

00:31:44.270 --> 00:31:45.980
If you still mean to shield her,

00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:48.180
it won't be as easy as before.

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:50.140
Why must you kill her?

00:31:52.030 --> 00:31:53.770
She's the one least tied

00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:54.980
to this mess.

00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:57.860
Dragging her

00:31:57.920 --> 00:31:59.700
into this storm,

00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:02.140
do you feel guilty?

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:03.330
Wind rises!

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:04.290
Blade-Ruin Array!

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:28.250
It takes time to break

00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:29.380
my Blade-Ruin Array.

00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:32.730
You won't live to see him.

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:34.460
Die!

00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:58.140
You forced the array to save her.

00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:00.050
Had you let her go,

00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:02.180
you wouldn't be this badly hurt.

00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:03.980
What-ifs

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:06.660
are meaningless.

00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:08.700
But in the end,

00:33:09.270 --> 00:33:10.290
I'm the winner!

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:16.420
This blade's seen years.

00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:18.530
Thirty-two years ago,

00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:19.660
when I first wandered the jianghu,

00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:21.290
I bought it for two taels.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.570
It's broken three times since,

00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:26.290
patched and cased,

00:33:26.350 --> 00:33:27.730
sixteen years without light.

00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:31.810
Now drawn again,

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:33.730
it can take

00:33:33.790 --> 00:33:35.860
Master Su's fine head...

00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:39.420
Lucky for it, I'd say.

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:42.660
Take my fine head?
