00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.980
[Based on the novel of the same name from Zhou Munan's Youth in Jianghu series]

[Episode 32]

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.220
You were hit by countless blow of my blade qi

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.130
in order to protect that lass.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.450
You've sustained serious internal injuries.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.260
If you utilize your arts within the next 15 minutes,

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.290
I don't even need to kill you.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.340
You'll die from the severance of your nerves and meridians.

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.850
Mr. Su.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:28.380
Second Master Tu.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:29.380
Mr. Su,

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.100
stop calling me that.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.660
You may call me Tu Wan.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.450
You and I are friends.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.100
Use this time to regulate your breathing.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.060
I'll buy you some time.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.200
15 minutes, huh?

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:01.500
I wish to give it a try.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.240
Do you wish to save him?

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.290
Yes, I do.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.130
I want to save him.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.260
You think you can save him?

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.730
Judging from your cultivation stage,

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:13.780
I suppose you haven't reached the Vajra Mortal-Stage yet.

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:16.660
It seems I'm being belittled.

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:28.500
Since you can corner Mr. Su to this extent,

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.410
I suppose you're running out of strength as well.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:31.660
Perhaps the current you

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.010
is weaker than a Vajra Mortal-Stage cultivator!

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:36.610
Since you have a death wish,

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.500
I shall grant your wish.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.820
Stop!

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.080
Now, even a drugged puppet

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.780
is enough to corner me to this extent.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.820
If they form an army with these puppets,

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.890
I'm sure Prince of Langya

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:59.940
will be no match for Yong.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.010
It's just that this Night Crow is...

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.540
Perfect.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.060
What a shame.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.660
Ms. Night Crow, what are you lamenting about?

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.140
It's a shame that I can never create

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.700
another perfect drugged puppet like him.

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:21.050
The others

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.850
are inferior to him.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:27.420
You'll find similar ones eventually.

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.130
After all, there are plenty of good prospects left

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.060
in Tianqi City.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.700
Tonight is a good night

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:36.850
to reap some lives.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:00.290
Tu Wan!

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:01.580
Just leave!

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:04.490
Mr. Su,

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:06.220
it hasn't even been

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:07.780
15 minutes yet.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.460
You've done more than enough.

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:10.490
If this continues,

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:11.900
you'll die!

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:14.580
It's been some time

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.730
since I arrived at Tianqi City.

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:17.490
I've heard of your name before.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.250
You're Second Master Tu of Thousand-Gold Tower.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.100
So, are the people of Thousand-Gold Tower

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.220
also willing to risk their lives

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:24.580
for their friends' sake?

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:32.580
Who said I wouldn't risk my life for my friends

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:34.930
just because I'm Second Master Tu?

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:37.900
What if I'm Tu Wan, then?

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:40.490
Can I sacrifice myself for my friends, then?

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.930
When a man encounters a woman he fancies,

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:46.370
and, he can't forget about her after their first encounter,

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:48.460
we call that love at first sight.

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:50.220
But for men,

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.220
if we ever meet a man we can entrust ourselves to after our encounter,

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.660
we call that an instant bond.

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:00.610
Mr. Su and I

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.210
had an instant bond.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.170
Excellent words.

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:32.900
Mr. Su,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:34.930
I'm incompetent at martial arts.

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.660
This is the furthest I can go.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:55.980
How could this be?

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.610
It hasn't even been

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:00.810
15 minutes yet.

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.100
It's because I'm Su Muyu.

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.020
I'm Su Muyu of Blood River.

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:07.760
Therefore, I'm always

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.410
stronger

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:10.930
than what people think of me.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.050
Fine.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.610
Initially, I wanted to visit a pleasure house.

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:38.730
But suddenly, I sensed

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.020
a strong killing intent coming from here.

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:42.900
Back then, I turned around and ran away.

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:46.270
I ran across three streets in a row.

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:47.970
In my mind, I was thinking

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:49.700
that I should come and take a look.

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:52.980
But in reality,

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:55.100
I was still terrified.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.100
My fear suddenly went away

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.810
when he unsheathed his sword.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:06.660
Perhaps I'll turn into someone

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.730
like Big Brother in the future.

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:11.780
Someone fat-headed and big-eared,

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:13.140
sly and deceitful.

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:14.460
But now,

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:16.900
I'm still Tu Wan.

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:19.730
I can sacrifice myself

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:21.850
for my friends.

00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:38.490
Thank you so much.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.100
I'll surely remember

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:43.770
your kindness today.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.300
I'll take Miss Bai and treat her condition first.

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:47.820
I'll entrust this place to you.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:49.850
Go ahead. Don't worry.

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:03.610
It seems this ancient manual

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:06.310
is related

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:08.010
to the puppet spell somehow.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:10.850
The puppet spell

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:12.980
is now in the grasp of Medicine King Valley.

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:16.010
If I can receive the help of Medicine King,

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:19.940
perhaps I can catch a glimpse of its secrets.

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:23.460
Come in.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:25.940
Ms. Yun.

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:30.600
I instructed you to infiltrate the ranks of

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:32.730
the deputy commander's Jinwu Guards.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:34.920
But now, you're paying me a visit.

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.130
Has the deputy commander's son's illness

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.370
shown signs of improvement?

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:39.960
Second Master Tu of Thousand-Gold Tower

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:40.850
brought a healer here.

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:42.530
The deputy commander

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:43.820
wanted her to stay.

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:46.820
But one of their friends suddenly came here

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:47.820
and took them away.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:49.060
What happened after that?

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:51.770
What happened after they left

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:52.940
the deputy commander's manor?

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:55.180
After they left the deputy commander's manor,

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:56.580
they encountered an assassin.

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:57.940
Who was the assassin?

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:00.340
The assassin wielded six blades.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.850
Was it Xu Liuyun, the Blade Ghost of Nanjue?

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:04.340
Indeed.

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:06.370
I didn't dare to get near them.

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:07.820
I merely observed the encounter from afar.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.100
It seemed like the healer was injured.

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:11.940
I think she was

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:13.940
the assassin's true target

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:14.940
from the start.

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:19.300
So, his friend was able to kill the Blade Ghost.

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:22.520
And, the healer was targeted by

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:23.730
the Blade Ghost.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:27.180
You said Second Master Tu

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.490
hired them to provide treatment, right?

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:30.820
Which clinic do they come from?

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:33.420
He-Yu Clinic of Mingcheng Alley.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:35.940
I understand now.

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:45.940
I finished off

00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:46.980
your Wolf.

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:51.700
How come your Tiger

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:52.730
can finish off my Wolf?

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:54.710
Isn't it common for tigers

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:55.890
to prey on wolves?

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.420
Wolves come in packs.

00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:00.300
Tigers are solitary beasts.

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:02.770
As the saying goes, two fists cannot stand against four hands.

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:04.060
Your tiger is alone.

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:05.210
It's no match for my pack of wolves.

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:07.770
Where's your pack of wolves, then?

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:14.180
Over here.

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:14.650
This...

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:15.770
Are you sure about this?

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:17.730
Can't I do so?

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:24.060
I'm dead.

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:33.130
Why isn't Master back yet?

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:34.580
Don't worry.

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.060
Master Su is there.

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:38.010
Even if it's the deputy commander's manor,

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.250
he can still enter and exit at will.

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:42.100
Enough.

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:43.490
If you're still worried about them,

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:44.980
I'll perform divination for you.

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:48.100
By divination, you meant tossing a coin.

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:49.170
Is it even accurate?

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:50.610
It had always worked.

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:57.420
Su Muyu hasn't returned yet.

00:11:58.550 --> 00:11:59.820
Why aren't you panicking at all?

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:04.960
I remember that someone was panicking

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:05.910
when

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:07.610
we were in Tianqi City.

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:10.730
Times have changed.

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:12.300
Yu is amazing.

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:13.730
I don't think he needs

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:15.130
a useless and harmless person like me to worry about him.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:16.770
I think

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:18.370
we should be worried about

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:19.850
the deputy commander instead.

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:21.820
Wait.

00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:24.370
Was that another joke?

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:28.100
What if

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:29.940
I were there instead of Mr. Su?

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:31.850
Would you worry about me?

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:38.540
I mean,

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:41.420
I'm the current head of the family.

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:47.710
If only I could use my Poison-Sand Palm now.

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:48.890
I would've killed you in an instant.

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:50.370
You think

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:51.610
you're a worthy head of family?

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:06.980
This is bad.

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:23.130
Master.

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:31.060
Xu Liuyun is dead.

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:32.420
How could that be?

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:33.850
Isn't he the Blade Ghost?

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:35.340
Even so, he's a human.

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:37.250
He's not unkillable.

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:39.930
General Dian,

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.560
your uncle,

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:43.160
hired him to assassinate the miracle physician

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:44.290
of Medicine King Valley.

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:46.490
He was inferior to Umbrella Ghost.

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:47.770
He was killed off instead.

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:49.100
I suppose

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.610
he's panicking right now.

00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:55.010
He'll surely mobilize

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:57.010
more of his hidden blades in the dark.

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:03.890
I don't need to worry

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:06.010
if it's Uncle we're talking about.

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:08.940
Yong.

00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:13.260
Are you not worried

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:15.420
due to the fact

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:16.780
that he's your uncle?

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:19.060
Or are you not worried

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:21.810
due to his capabilities?

00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:28.500
Now,

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:30.180
you're already better than me.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.380
You wish to get something done,

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:34.810
but you don't want to dirty your hands.

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:36.210
I suppose kinship

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.900
is an excellent tool indeed.

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:45.140
Let's see

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:47.420
if Uncle can get things done

00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:48.500
in a beautiful manner.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:49.850
If not,

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:51.900
we have no choice but to depend on Su Changhe.

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:53.540
He's

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:55.660
a double-edged sword.

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:05.450
Her bleeding has been stopped.

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:06.930
Yu,

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:07.730
did you use

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:08.970
the Unyielding Gold on Master?

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:10.850
I think so.

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:12.660
Miss Bai instructed me to do so.

00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:14.690
But she fainted

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:16.330
before I managed to do it.

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:17.610
You did great.

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.380
Without it,

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:20.380
I suppose

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:21.810
no one could save her.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:23.810
Master was struck by blades.

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:24.660
The blade qi

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:25.730
is still within her body.

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:27.900
We have to force it out of her.

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:29.420
Head of Mu family.

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:30.380
Yes.

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:31.450
Listen to my command.

00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:32.540
When I give you the signal,

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:33.610
strike Master's Baihui acupoint

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:34.540
with your palm.

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:35.660
Don't use too much force.

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:37.780
Make sure it's gentle yet strong at the same time.

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:39.060
If not,

00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:40.210
even if Master does survive,

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:41.970
her skull will be dented.

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:43.020
She'll be furious.

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:43.810
I understand.

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:44.850
This is my expertise.

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:52.810
Zhaoyan,

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:54.140
what do I need to do?

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:57.210
Yu,

00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:59.140
you don't need to do anything for now.

00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:00.450
You were seriously wounded as well.

00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:02.260
You should rest and recuperate.

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:07.180
Okay.

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:09.020
Just focus on saving her.

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:10.260
You may ignore me.

00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:20.140
Yu.

00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:21.060
What happened?

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:22.900
When Miss Bai went out to give diagnoses,

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:24.170
she realized

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:26.210
that some noblemen were struck by the puppet poison.

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.020
She was ambushed on her way back.

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:29.500
She was seriously wounded.

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:31.690
I failed to protect Miss Bai.

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:33.140
Could the assailant be

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:35.330
Xu Liuyun?

00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:37.610
How did you know?

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.540
This morning, I received news

00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:41.730
that Xu Liuyun, the Blade Ghost, had entered Tianqi City.

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:43.780
And, he even made contact with Flying Tiger General's Residence.

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:45.180
I didn't expect him

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:46.810
to act this quickly.

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:48.570
Did he escape?

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:49.850
He's already dead.

00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:53.020
The culprit was Flying Tiger General.

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:56.090
It seems Changhe's initial speculation was spot-on.

00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:58.210
This was the work of Xiao Yong, the first prince.

00:16:58.630 --> 00:16:59.500
And, that Night Crow,

00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:02.730
it's likely that she's hiding in Flying Tiger General's Residence.

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.780
We kept a close eye on their residence

00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:06.540
in order to track down Night Crow.

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:07.460
However,

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:08.850
they always tried to throw us off with tricks,

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:11.130
causing us to expend a lot of energy to track them down.

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:12.940
In the end, it was a ruse.

00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:14.540
It seems the Blade Ghost

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:17.060
left the residence

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:18.260
when we were tricked by the feint attack.

00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:20.330
I need to head there.

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:21.300
Yu,

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:22.300
have you lost your mind?

00:17:22.590 --> 00:17:23.330
Just ignore me.

00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:25.090
Keep guard over the place.

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:25.890
Yu, you mustn't.

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:27.300
Your current priority

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:28.170
is to rest and recuperate.

00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:29.810
If you seek revenge

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:30.740
in this state,

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:32.260
you'll lose more than you'll gain.

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:33.260
What do you think will happen next

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:34.650
if I don't head there

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:35.610
right now?

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:39.500
Do you think He-Yu Clinic will still be safe?

00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:41.740
If I were them, and I found out

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:45.220
that Miss Bai has figured out the secret behind the drugged puppets,

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:47.060
I would get rid of her

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:48.130
at all costs.

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:49.540
Even if the Blade Ghost is dead,

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:52.890
I'll send out the rest of my elite members

00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:54.460
to hunt her down.

00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:57.460
It seems a group of elites

00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:59.540
will gather at this clinic soon.

00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:00.890
Some of the arrays set up by

00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:02.260
Qingyang and I are still active.

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:04.300
It shouldn't be that easy for outsiders to enter this place.

00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:06.500
What if we shift Miss Bai elsewhere?

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:08.740
What if we shift her to the secret chamber where Changhe is meditating?

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:10.370
Although I know nothing about medicine,

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:12.570
there are similarities between the arts of poison and the arts of medicine.

00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:14.300
We can't afford to move her around now.

00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:16.060
If we do,

00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:17.370
her zhenqi will react wildly.

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:19.370
And, she might die at any time.

00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:24.500
That's why I have to go.

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:26.850
I have to show them

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:29.090
my rage.

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:31.300
I understand now.

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:33.130
You're trying to tell them

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:34.850
that Miss Bai is dead.

00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:36.890
That's why you're so enraged

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:37.980
that you're forsaking your life.

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:41.090
Fine.

00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:41.780
Yu,

00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:42.460
I'll join you.

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:43.940
Stay here and protect everyone.

00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:44.850
But Yu...

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.060
Changhe is still on a reclusive retreat.

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:48.300
We have to depend on you.

00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:52.260
All right.

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:54.500
Xuewei and I will remain here.

00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:56.810
Yu, you don't need to worry.

00:18:58.880 --> 00:18:59.780
Take care.

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:25.370
They're here.

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:54.260
[Tranquil Delight]

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:55.220
All of you, stand back!

00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:57.170
Is this

00:19:58.030 --> 00:19:58.850
an array?

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:01.410
Evil spirits.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:02.940
These are mere tricks.

00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:04.940
I'll dispel it.

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:30.890
So, it's you.

00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:34.700
I did think about who my inner demon would be.

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:38.090
It could've been Yi Bu, who dictated our lives for many years.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.700
Or my grandfather, who constantly lectured

00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:42.540
and disciplined me.

00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:45.020
Perhaps it could've been myself as well.

00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:47.020
But I never expected it

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:48.540
to be you.

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:50.300
Su Muyu,

00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:52.450
perhaps I envied your straightforward

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:54.260
and carefree spirit all this while.

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:55.810
But this time,

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:57.980
as my inner demon,

00:20:58.070 --> 00:20:59.300
I get to face you again.

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:00.610
This time,

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:03.170
I won't back off.

00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:15.260
Qingyang and I

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:17.300
had set up the Myriad Fantasy Array outside.

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:18.940
Those who enter the array will be trapped there,

00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:20.060
and their inner demon will be shown.

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:21.130
But I'll set up

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:22.890
another poison array around the courtyard just in case.

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:23.810
All right.

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:51.220
We're reaching the crucial moment.

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:53.020
We can't afford to let anyone interrupt the process.

00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:53.980
Understood.

00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:55.500
I'll make sure

00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:56.570
no one will interrupt us.

00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:10.940
Xuewei,

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:12.850
your inner force is the gentlest among us.

00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:13.610
Head inside

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:14.890
and expel the blade qi from Miss Bai's body.

00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:16.220
Yumo and I will keep guard here.

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:21.570
All right.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:29.810
The array has been dispelled.

00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:31.810
Xie,

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:33.130
you're extraordinary indeed.

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:35.500
But there's one more poison array within.

00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:37.170
I do not excel at the arts of poison.

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:39.810
Night Crow, please do something about it.

00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:43.780
An array within an array, huh?

00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:46.060
The poisonous miasma in the courtyard is pretty strong.

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:47.740
We shouldn't let it go to waste.

00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:49.300
Go now.

00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:04.330
He's absorbing Xuewei's poisonous miasma.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.410
I don't care if you're his senior brother or not.

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:14.460
If you dare to step into the house,

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:15.980
I will kill you.

00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:30.090
So,

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:31.650
this is the person

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:33.220
who absorbed Xuewei's poison.

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:36.740
Night Crow created this Gold-Body Puppet

00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:38.740
and made him absorb Xuewei's poison.

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:40.740
He's Tang Lianyue's senior brother

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:41.940
and the deputy sect leader of Tang Clan,

00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:43.170
Tang Linghuang.

00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:44.260
So,

00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:45.810
not only does he possess

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:46.700
Xuewei's arts of poison,

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:48.570
but he's also a Heaven-level master, huh?

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:50.020
That's right.

00:23:50.790 --> 00:23:52.330
He's troublesome to deal with.

00:23:57.070 --> 00:23:57.780
General!

00:23:58.830 --> 00:23:59.460
General!

00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:00.410
General!

00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:02.130
This is bad!

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:03.370
Someone has infiltrated our residence!

00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:04.020
Who?

00:24:04.030 --> 00:24:04.610
It's me!

00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:23.780
Su Muyu of Blood River,

00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:25.220
how dare you?

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:26.740
What are you doing here?

00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:28.500
Blood River invited Miss Bai

00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:29.570
to Tianqi as our guest.

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:31.260
To us,

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:33.780
she's our dearest friend.

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:36.410
I once told her

00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:38.220
that I would ensure her safety

00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:40.700
as long as I was around.

00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:44.220
But now, she's dead.

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:46.650
She was killed by the assassin

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:48.700
you hired.

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:52.500
I want you to give me an account.

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:55.300
Why should I?

00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:57.020
This is your choice.

00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:01.090
And I will make my choice now.

00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:07.260
Do you know what kind of offense it is

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:09.260
to kill a general in Beili?

00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:10.570
You will die by a thousand cuts,

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:12.540
and three generations of your kin will be executed.

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:14.850
Three generations of my kin, huh?

00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:24.570
Su Muyu,

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:25.780
you're seriously wounded.

00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:27.500
If you utilize your sword energy now,

00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:28.370
you'll die for sure.

00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:30.780
Even if you win, it'll be a Pyrrhic victory.

00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:32.170
You'd better think twice.

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:33.410
Don't be reckless.

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:35.130
Don't be reckless?

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:37.890
This is the first time anyone has said that to me.

00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:40.170
But this time,

00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:43.130
I feel like being reckless!

00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:08.410
The poisonous miasma has been completely absorbed.

00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:10.060
Aren't you going to head inside?

00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:12.980
Let me try out the power of the enhanced drugged puppet.

00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:17.230
Su Muyu has infiltrated the general's residence.

00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:18.450
The situation is dire.

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:19.060
Everyone,

00:26:19.270 --> 00:26:20.220
please head back immediately.

00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:22.260
Su Muyu isn't here?

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:24.020
He went to the general's residence instead?

00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:25.570
But why?

00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:27.540
He said General killed the miracle physician.

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:29.220
He went there to avenge her out of spite.

00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:31.250
But judging from his state,

00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:32.060
I suppose he has lost his mind.

00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:33.850
We've already dispatched the Jinwu Guards

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:35.260
to the residence as reinforcements.

00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:37.020
Did he actually say

00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:39.170
that Bai Hehuai was dead?

00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:40.060
She's surely dead.

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:41.460
Su Muyu was seriously wounded

00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:42.570
when he infiltrated the residence.

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:43.740
However,

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:45.300
from the way he was swinging his sword,

00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:46.890
I think he was trying to fight with reckless abandon.

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:48.850
If you guys don't head there,

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:49.780
I'm afraid

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:51.260
he'll massacre the entire residence.

00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:56.980
Yu,

00:26:57.550 --> 00:26:58.500
could it be

00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:00.260
that we're going to die here?

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:02.370
Let's head back!

00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:12.370
Stop!

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:21.500
Fine, then.

00:27:33.550 --> 00:27:34.370
Who would've expected

00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:36.090
both of us

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:38.460
to almost die from Xuewei's poison.

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:42.540
It seems Yu

00:27:42.550 --> 00:27:43.610
created a commotion that was huge enough.

00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:44.890
That's why they were lured back.

00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:45.850
Are you guys okay?

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:53.700
This poison is...

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:00.260
Take this.

00:28:05.270 --> 00:28:05.810
Don't worry.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:06.540
I'll be fine.

00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:07.740
How's Miss Bai doing?

00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:09.410
Miss Bai is safe now.

00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:10.940
Great.

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:26.220
I finally understand

00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:29.170
why Yi Bu and the rest

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:30.700
would regard

00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:32.500
a martial arts organization this highly.

00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:34.500
One can catch a glimpse

00:28:34.790 --> 00:28:36.130
of Blood River's formidable power

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:38.090
on Master Su alone.

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:40.850
It makes those of us

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:42.980
who barely survived the battlefield

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:46.130
seem all the more insignificant.

00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:48.130
General, you once slew your enemies

00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:49.300
on the battlefield valiantly

00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:50.500
with your battle axes.

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:52.700
But now, you're manipulating people

00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:54.300
and plotting sinister plots in Tianqi City.

00:28:54.790 --> 00:28:55.980
Do you even remember

00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:57.540
who you once were?

00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:12.500
Xie Zaiye.

00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:13.890
Master Su.

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:16.170
You're truly disappointing.

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:18.810
It seems Changhe was right back then.

00:29:19.550 --> 00:29:20.460
Sometimes,

00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:22.780
we should uproot everything

00:29:23.550 --> 00:29:24.650
without leaving a single one behind.

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:26.890
I'm very impressed

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:28.330
by the courage you and Patriarch possessed.

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:30.500
I also regret the fact

00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:32.780
that I'm not as courageous or capable as you two.

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:35.220
But this is my own choice.

00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:52.410
Indeed.

00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:55.060
It's because Changhe and I are strong enough.

00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:56.810
That's why we can

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:58.700
get rid of the weeds

00:29:59.590 --> 00:30:01.300
that are growing again.

00:30:04.030 --> 00:30:04.890
It's been some time

00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:05.890
since our last battle.

00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:06.940
It seems

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:08.540
your inner force has improved considerably.

00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:11.090
However, it's not as if my progress remained stagnant.

00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:58.060
Tang Linghuang.

00:30:58.310 --> 00:30:59.500
Your zhenqi is leaking everywhere,

00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:00.980
your sword aura is intact,

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:03.130
and your killing intent has gotten stronger.

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:05.540
Master Su,

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:07.330
it seems you've gone demonic.

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:08.890
Looks like my martial aunt

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:10.980
is someone special to you.

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:12.740
Night Crow.

00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:15.220
I will kill you.

00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:21.500
You think you can kill me in that state?

00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:24.330
You just took Tang Linghuang's attack head-on.

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:26.650
Now, we don't need to do anything.

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:29.130
You'll die from the poison

00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:31.020
within 7-8 minutes.

00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:32.940
But you're Su Muyu after all.

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:35.810
You overthrew both Blood River and Shadow Sect.

00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:38.130
Who knows what will happen

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:40.810
if we let you leave?

00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:41.890
So,

00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:43.940
it's time for you to die here.

00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:04.300
It's my first time seeing you in this state,

00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:05.130
young Muyu.

00:32:06.790 --> 00:32:07.460
Master.

00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:09.370
Where's young Changhe?

00:32:11.030 --> 00:32:12.090
If he sees you

00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:13.410
in this pathetic state,

00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:15.500
he'll surely mock you first.

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:17.220
After that,

00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:20.300
he'll kill all of them.

00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:21.610
Who are you?

00:32:22.030 --> 00:32:23.330
Night Crow, the ghost physician.

00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:25.850
A traitor of Medicine King Valley.

00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:27.940
You were bold enough to turn

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:30.300
the future leader of the Tang Clan into a drugged puppet.

00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:32.090
Now that you've offended them,

00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:34.740
you won't get away easily.

00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:36.460
Kill them!

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.060
Hell Palm?

00:32:50.550 --> 00:32:51.130
Should we go after them?

00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:51.940
No need for that.

00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:53.370
Even if we do catch up to them,

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.460
she'll kill all of you.

00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:24.370
Young Muyu, look at

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:25.260
how pathetic you look.

00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:39.370
Fake diviner of the Mu family,

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:40.740
since you're here,

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:42.850
you should stop hiding.

00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:44.020
Who are you?

00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:52.740
You are...

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:54.610
It's me.

00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:56.610
Long time no see, Mu Qingyang.

00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:00.090
Have you been to Mount Wangcheng

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:02.610
and visited the sword deity you admired?

00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:05.700
Aren't you the owner of the library,

00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:07.130
Su Yunxiu?

00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:09.100
[Su Yunxiu, Blood River]

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:11.500
I thought you were dead.

00:34:12.670 --> 00:34:14.090
I merely left Blood River.

00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:16.540
They couldn't track me down.

00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:18.340
They had no choice but to say that I was dead.

00:34:19.150 --> 00:34:20.460
I'm Su Yunxiu, you know?

00:34:21.550 --> 00:34:22.500
I taught

00:34:22.590 --> 00:34:24.650
both Su Muyu and Su Changhe.

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:27.060
It's impossible for me to die that easily.

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:29.380
Why do you still

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:31.730
look the same?

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:33.170
Yeah.

00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:35.570
I wonder

00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:37.460
why I still look the same.

00:34:41.150 --> 00:34:41.940
Su Muyu!

00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:46.250
You're here.

00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:47.860
How's Miss Bai?

00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:50.170
Miss Bai is fine.

00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:51.340
I'm here to fetch you back.

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:52.500
This is great.

00:34:53.590 --> 00:34:54.420
Young Muyu,

00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:57.250
your teacher is still alive.

00:34:57.760 --> 00:34:59.460
I'm standing right in front of you.

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:01.110
Why didn't you exhibit

00:35:01.110 --> 00:35:02.690
any signs of joy at all?

00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:04.900
Master, they said you were dead.

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:07.860
Changhe and I investigated the area after that.

00:35:09.070 --> 00:35:10.420
We were 90% confident

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:12.250
that you had escaped.

00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:14.130
What about the last 10%?

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:16.460
For the last 10%,

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:18.860
it was likely that you changed your identity

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:21.570
and joined Blood River again.

00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:25.420
You do live up to your name as my disciple.

00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:28.570
But young Muyu,

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:30.540
this is my first time seeing you

00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:31.650
this hot-headed.

00:35:32.590 --> 00:35:33.770
Why did you do so?

00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:37.900
A good friend of ours,

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:39.900
the miracle physician, Bai Hehuai,

00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:41.860
was seriously wounded by our foes

00:35:42.070 --> 00:35:43.060
after she figured out their secrets.

00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:44.090
And,

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:45.420
they wanted to silence her.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.170
Su Muyu was seriously wounded as well

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:48.770
when he rescued her.

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:50.170
And now,

00:35:50.590 --> 00:35:52.500
Miss Bai needs to rest and recuperate in a safe environment.

00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:54.250
Therefore, Su Muyu

00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:55.940
pretended that Miss Bai was dead

00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:57.730
and that he wanted to seek revenge.

00:35:58.760 --> 00:35:59.980
Only then would we be able to lure them away.

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:02.420
He pretended to be enraged?

00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:05.860
To me, you were

00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:07.730
obviously enraged.

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:10.020
Master, you're right.

00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:12.290
I wasn't pretending.

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:14.540
That wasn't enough.

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:16.980
Not yet.

00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:19.290
Was my rage not enough?

00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:20.540
No.

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:23.060
The reason you gave us isn't convincing enough.

00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:28.500
You

00:36:29.590 --> 00:36:30.610
fancy her, don't you?

00:36:33.550 --> 00:36:34.170
Indeed.

00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:35.980
I fancy her.

00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:41.900
This is great.

00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:45.340
Why do you say so?

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.290
It's because someone finally made

00:36:49.150 --> 00:36:51.340
Su Muyu fall in love.

00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:53.170
That's great.

00:36:54.110 --> 00:36:54.940
Su Muyu,

00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:57.820
I'm happy to see your current state.

00:36:58.710 --> 00:37:00.170
Although you're in a pathetic state now,

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:02.380
this is

00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:03.940
the most handsome you

00:37:04.110 --> 00:37:05.420
I've ever seen.

00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:09.770
Do you know what an iceberg becomes

00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:11.460
when it melts?

00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:13.020
Master,

00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:14.820
please stop teasing me.

00:37:17.110 --> 00:37:19.130
It becomes the roaring ocean, silly boy.

00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:24.340
All right now.

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:25.540
I'm going to leave.

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:28.690
I was just passing by Tianqi City.

00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:29.820
I didn't expect

00:37:30.190 --> 00:37:32.420
to witness such an interesting turn of events.

00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:35.730
I know

00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:38.060
that you could've left the residence by yourself.

00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:40.020
You still have your trump card.

00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:41.540
But you and young Changhe

00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:43.020
are trying to create

00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:44.900
a new Blood River after all.

00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:48.020
If so, there's no room

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.340
for any error.

00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:09.570
Su Muyu!

00:38:10.510 --> 00:38:11.170
Let's go.

00:39:13.590 --> 00:39:15.210
What exactly went wrong?

00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:18.980
Why can't I break my limit and reach the ninth level?

00:39:21.590 --> 00:39:22.250
What is it?

00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:23.500
Changhe,

00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:25.540
we received a message from Flying Tiger General's Residence.

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:26.820
They asked you when you would finish your retreat.

00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:35.060
Why are they so impatient?

00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:38.250
I'll do it when the time is right.

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:44.500
Last night,

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:46.650
something happened at Flying Tiger General's Residence.

00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:48.130
What happened?

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:50.860
Firstly, Miss Bai

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:52.170
found out about their secrets.

00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:53.980
Due to that, she was seriously wounded.

00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:56.210
After that, in order to lure their foes away,

00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:57.860
Yu disregarded the wounds that he had sustained

00:39:58.150 --> 00:39:59.860
and attacked Flying Tiger General's Residence forcefully.

00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:01.560
Yu almost

00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:02.900
wiped all of them out.

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:05.170
They only managed to drive back Yu

00:40:05.170 --> 00:40:06.250
after their reinforcements arrived.

00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:09.250
Now, both Yu and Miss Bai

00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:10.290
are seriously wounded.

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:12.290
They're hiding

00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:13.690
in a remote house as we speak.

00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:18.340
Have Dian Ye and his men lost their minds?

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:22.290
I said that I could help them.

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:24.460
But under no circumstances

00:40:24.510 --> 00:40:25.610
are our Blood River members to be harmed.

00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:28.570
Changhe,

00:40:29.550 --> 00:40:31.380
why must we work with them?

00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:32.920
If we had stepped in

00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:33.940
in time last night,

00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:35.360
Yu might not

00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:36.570
have been hurt that badly.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:37.900
