[Blood River]

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.980
[Based on the novel of the same name from Zhou Munan's Youth in Jianghu series]

[Episode 33]

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.690
Changhe,

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.490
why must we work with them?

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.050
If we had stepped in

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.050
in time last night,

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.540
Muyu might not

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.690
have been hurt that badly.

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:50.050
You're questioning me?

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.290
Your decision

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.210
must have your reasons.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.820
Go tell Dian Ye

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:16.780
my cooperation with them

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.940
is limited to helping them

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.100
take on the Prince of Langya.

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:20.690
When I leave seclusion,

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:21.780
everything will be decided.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:23.850
Tell them they'd better...

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.380
not act rashly.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.010
Understood.

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:36.220
Go.

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.100
Something big happened.

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.380
Your Highness, Deputy General He seeks audience.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.410
Your Highness, urgent report!

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.540
Speak.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.660
From your look,

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.890
it's definitely not the kind

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.170
of news you want heard.

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.370
When General Lei struck Nanxu City,

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.130
he was ambushed.

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.130
Then he led a small squad to break out,

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.940
and is now fleeing to Mount Luolei.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.660
We do have some troops there,

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:04.690
but if Nanjue is set on sealing the mountain,

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:05.290
I'm afraid...

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:07.100
No reinforcements?

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.100
All tied down by Nanjue's main force.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.060
They've gone all out,

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.170
willing to pay any price,

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.730
just to take down our commander.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.050
Mount Luolei...

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.020
Your Highness.

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:32.220
Go.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:34.460
Bring him back.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.290
Undercurrents run deep in Tianqi City,

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.020
how can I leave now?

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:42.190
I'll be fine.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:43.700
In Tianqi City,

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.410
no one can threaten me.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.340
I just hate

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:49.050
that this time I can't...

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.980
Your Highness!

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:55.540
Where is Ji Ruofeng?

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.850
Why isn't he back yet?

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:00.820
He took Chuhe

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.660
to the Miao Territory to find Dragonfire Herb

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.850
and Cinnabar Spiders.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.370
He found clues in ancient texts.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.140
Taken together,

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.610
they can suppress the frost poison in me.

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:16.220
I keep feeling

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.460
someone's deliberately moving your people away.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:20.660
Xinyue,

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.250
right now,

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:23.900
every extra word you say

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.250
could well become

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.340
a lifelong regret.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.050
But, Your Highness...

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.930
In this world,

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:34.340
everyone

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:35.490
has something

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:37.020
we absolutely cannot lose.

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.980
I have it.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:39.100
You do too.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.220
When the worst

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.220
inevitably comes,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.410
then...

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:47.290
cast everything aside.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.660
I'm sorry,

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:57.980
Your Highness.

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:32.900
Your Highness.

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:36.170
Something major happened

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.100
in Tianqi City last night.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.220
Su Muyu fought Nanjue's Blade Ghost,

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:41.170
Xu Liuyun.

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:42.700
Xu Liuyun was killed.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:44.580
As for Su Muyu's side,

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.170
that young physician Bai Hehuai

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:47.460
from Medicine King Valley

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:48.900
seems to have met with misfortune.

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:50.700
After that, Su Muyu stormed

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:51.780
the Flying Tiger General's residence,

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:54.050
even drawing in the Jinwu Guards.

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:55.810
Now He-Yu Clinic

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.250
stands emptied out.

00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.100
As for the exact cause,

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:00.490
I don't yet know.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.290
You'll know soon.

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:10.730
Mu Qingyang of the Mu family

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:11.930
pays respects to Your Highness

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:13.610
and Xuanwu Guardian.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:15.540
Have a seat.

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:21.660
Looks like

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.290
Your Highness was not surprised

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:24.410
by my arrival.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:25.780
About last night,

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:27.140
Lianyue told me.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:29.730
The miracle physician...

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:33.020
She's alive.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:34.410
That's good.

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:36.580
Not entirely.

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.020
Right now,

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:39.340
our Patriarch of Blood River

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:40.250
is in seclusion.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:41.980
One family head is badly hurt.

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:43.290
Another

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:44.540
is far away in Blood River.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:46.580
And the last

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:48.700
isn't much of a fighter,

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:49.980
and that's me.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:52.610
But now,

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:54.780
something outrageous has happened.

00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:55.900
So I think

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:57.580
we need the Guardians' help.

00:07:58.630 --> 00:07:59.340
There aren't several.

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:00.460
Only this one left.

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:04.540
What is it?

00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:07.660
What rotten luck!

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.290
Why are you the one left?

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:23.540
Muyu,

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:24.810
you're awake.

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:37.130
Why am I here?

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:39.460
He-Yu Clinic

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:40.370
is no longer safe.

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:43.130
It'll be under watch from now on.

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:44.940
So for now, we're hiding

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:45.850
at Ms. Wan'er's place.

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:48.130
Mr. Tu brought us here.

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:50.580
It's Ms. Wan'er

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:51.770
of Pleasure House?

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:53.250
That's her.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.430
Mr. Tu also said

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:56.460
Ms. Wan'er's place

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:58.530
is the quietest in Tianqi City,

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.530
so no one should disturb us.

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:02.820
Good.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.340
How's the miracle physician?

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.180
Zhaoyan says

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.370
she's out of danger,

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.530
but needs time

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:17.530
to wake up.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.130
Xuewei,

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:20.940
please escort her

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.700
out of Tianqi City

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:23.700
to Nan'an.

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:26.130
No.

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.650
No one can protect her in Nan'an now.

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:29.820
Send her to Blood River.

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:31.820
Uncle Zhe and Uncle Qidao are there.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:37.010
She's too weak now.

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:39.650
If she leaves Tianqi for Blood River,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.170
the road is too long,

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:42.220
she won't hold out.

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:44.010
Muyu,

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.250
don't worry.

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:47.530
Yumo has sent word to Blood River.

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:49.100
Uncle Zhe and Uncle Qidao

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.700
will dispatch reinforcements to Tianqi.

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:53.580
Then we're getting some serious reinforcements.

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:56.360
[Good harvest this year. Next year, plant widely.]

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:57.890
Back in the old Blood River,

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:01.220
our intel

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:03.180
always told us

00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:04.980
who would appear where.

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:08.250
On which year, month, and day,

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:10.770
some even picky enough

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.920
to name the exact hour,

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:13.820
to kill the target.

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:16.250
Now the info I get

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.420
is all about

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.700
this year's yields

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.730
and next year's planting plans.

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:25.220
When did Blood River's broadswords

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.700
turn into sickles for cutting wheat?

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:31.130
Now our disciples have nothing to do,

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:33.820
no place to spend their strength.

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:35.390
So Master Su

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:36.820
gave us these tasks.

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:38.220
When they return

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.490
from Tianqi City,

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:40.890
we'll even be tested.

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:45.250
Tested how?

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:46.700
Anyone who fails

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:48.490
is expelled from the Three Families.

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:50.130
That's the toughest thing

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.010
Su Muyu has said

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:53.610
since becoming family head.

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:55.580
Uncle Qidao, you know,

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:57.130
Master Su

00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:58.180
is kind by nature.

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:00.100
But when he gives his word,

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:03.180
it's set in stone.

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:04.980
Our Xie family's the strongest,

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:06.340
so jobs like these

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:07.490
are easy for us.

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:10.770
The Su family... can manage too.

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:12.650
The Mu family has it rough.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.770
They like things spotless and aren't strong.

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:15.980
- I'm afraid... - Enough.

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:17.060
Stand down.

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:18.650
Yes, sir.

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:25.490
Nice.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:27.370
Su Muyu

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:29.490
has learned to tease people.

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:31.820
I think

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:34.100
he isn't teasing.

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:37.420
He's serious.

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:38.610
By the way,

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:39.940
they had you stay

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.610
to help me with Blood River affairs,

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:42.820
but why didn't you...

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.460
I can't farm.

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:46.100
Why didn't you

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:48.010
go to Tianqi with them?

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:51.820
I'm just an old man.

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:53.820
They're all young.

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:55.530
Sometimes,

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:56.940
having us elders around

00:11:57.270 --> 00:11:58.420
just gets in the way,

00:11:58.630 --> 00:11:59.130
you know.

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:02.420
I don't.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.010
Then why didn't you go?

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:07.010
I...

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:09.580
Blood River is huge.

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:11.490
Someone has to sit in command.

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:13.700
Without a hand on them,

00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:15.730
they'll run wild.

00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:18.010
Big news!

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:20.940
Master, big news!

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:21.770
What is it?

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:24.340
Wild boars raided the cabbages?

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:24.890
No.

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:26.010
Something happened in Tianqi.

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:43.440
[He-Yu Clinic was attacked. Miracle Physician Bai was critically injured.]

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:43.940
[Master Su stormed and nearly destroyed]

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:44.540
[the Flying Tiger General's Residence.]

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:50.180
Su Zhe, what are you doing?

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:51.940
Flatten Tianqi!

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:08.980
So it's you.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:10.820
You're...

00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:13.250
Mu Xuewei, Poisonous Blossom of the Mu family.

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:14.530
Yumo's good friend.

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:16.850
Too bad the poison in me

00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:17.770
has been purged.

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:19.460
Otherwise, one palm from me

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:21.340
and you'd be dead.

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:25.340
Well,

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:26.850
he's a genius of the Tang Clan.

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:28.370
Your poisons are fierce.

00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:29.730
But to kill him,

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:30.980
that's nowhere near enough.

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:34.610
Let's go.

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:36.850
Where to?

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:38.530
I'd planned

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:39.890
to wait until the miracle physician woke

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:40.890
and ask her more.

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:42.650
But who knows when she'll wake.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:43.890
So now,

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:44.890
we can only investigate

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:45.850
that rotten commander's son.

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.650
I really hate Tianqi City.

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:48.580
Let's move.

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.250
To your Mount Wangcheng?

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:53.700
So, are you...

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:55.420
coming with us?

00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:00.460
They don't take women there.

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:04.820
Xuanwu Guardian,

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:06.730
let's split up then.

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:09.940
Where's Su Muyu and the rest?

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:13.610
He's hurt,

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.250
so of course he's inside.

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:26.180
Miss Yumo.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:27.850
What should I call you?

00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:29.710
Mr. Lianyue?

00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:35.180
Sounds like quite the perfect match.

00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:38.490
Now's not the time...

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:39.940
Now's not the time for this,

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:41.650
huh?

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:46.220
Then when is it?

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:47.890
Tomorrow?

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:49.340
The day after?

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:52.100
Or in the next life?

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:58.420
♪Thoughts that never fade, year after year gazing from afar...♪

00:14:58.870 --> 00:14:59.850
I'll only ask once.

00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:01.650
In your heart,

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:03.580
am I there?

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:05.730
Since we parted at the Tang Clan,

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:09.250
I often think of you.

00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:10.650
Good.

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:13.700
Then why never come find me?

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:17.820
I've been tracking my senior's trail.

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:22.490
Let me ask you again:

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:24.730
If your senior

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:25.700
is safely rescued,

00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:29.100
will you come to Blood River to marry me?

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.200
I'm a Tang Clan disciple

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:43.850
and Tianqi City's Xuanwu Guardian.

00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:47.220
If I go to Blood River to propose,

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:49.730
the grand master won't agree.

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:53.250
And His Highness would likely...

00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:54.180
I'm asking

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:54.940
if I'm in your heart.

00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:59.010
Did I ask about the Tang Clan?

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:01.370
Or the Prince of Langya's Manor?

00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:11.820
Enough.

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:13.180
I understand.

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:17.530
Miss Yumo...

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:20.730
- I didn't mean... - It's fine.

00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:23.130
I'm happy.

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:24.460
At least...

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:26.890
now I know I'm in your heart.

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:31.940
But I'm also sad.

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:37.380
♪Do not long for the sorrow of separation...♪

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:38.180
I didn't expect

00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:40.250
that in your mind,

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:41.610
Blood River ranks like this.

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.940
Is liking a woman of Blood River

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:48.580
so shameful?

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:50.100
That's not what I mean.

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:52.940
I've asked what I needed.

00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:54.460
From here on,

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:56.650
we're partners in action.

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:58.370
As for you senior,

00:16:58.840 --> 00:16:59.980
we'll help rescue him.

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.890
And for Muyu and the miracle physician,

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:04.730
we will have justice.

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:07.180
Let's go.

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:16.020
♪May this life leave no regrets♪

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:26.940
I'll leave you to talk.

00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:29.090
Thank you, Ms. Wan'er.

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:35.330
Have a seat.

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:44.090
Mr. Su,

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:46.460
seems you're badly hurt.

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:47.940
I'll need a few days' rest.

00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:50.140
I've been in Blood River for years.

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:52.050
Worse wounds than this

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:54.220
used to be routine.

00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:56.730
Still, my thanks to you.

00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:58.570
Without your care,

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:00.290
we'd likely be fleeing

00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:01.620
from Tianqi City by now.

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:03.700
Leaving now

00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:05.090
wouldn't be a bad idea.

00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:07.010
Now that we're in the thick of it,

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:08.730
we'll fight to the death,

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:09.810
no more hesitation.

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:11.700
That's our choice

00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:12.570
for Blood River.

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:15.490
Very well.

00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:17.900
Since I got back,

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:18.980
I've been tracking

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.460
General Li Xian's son.

00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:22.140
I found

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:23.180
something seriously off.

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:24.940
Yumo already started digging

00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:25.810
based on the lead

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:26.660
you gave me.

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:28.460
Now it seems

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:31.640
you've found more?

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:32.710
Yes.

00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:35.810
General Li Xian is brave,

00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:37.050
but his son

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:38.420
is not much good at martial arts.

00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:39.860
He's past twenty

00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:41.770
and still hasn't made deputy general.

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:43.580
Before,

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:44.330
a deputy commander

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:45.570
could easily get his son

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:46.490
promoted.

00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:48.250
But with the Prince of Langya now,

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:50.330
everything must be fair.

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:52.570
In fifteen days,

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:54.290
the Golden Throne Contest begins.

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:56.900
If he can rack up three straight wins,

00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:58.660
he will be appointed deputy general.

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:00.700
Can every Jinwu Guard join

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:03.530
the Golden Throne Contest?

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:05.050
Of course not.

00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:07.770
To enter the contest,

00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:09.330
you must first clear

00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:10.290
the Jinwu Guards' prelims.

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:12.620
Only forty-eight make the cut.

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:14.250
General Li Xian's son

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:15.330
couldn't even pass

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:16.250
the prelims at first.

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:17.730
But ten days ago,

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:19.900
he stunned everyone in the prelims,

00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:22.250
earning a direct slot for the contest.

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:23.860
Soon after,

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:26.140
news spread he fell ill.

00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:28.900
So, in that window,

00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:31.250
he used some method

00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:32.570
to boost his power,

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:34.460
most likely...

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:37.250
the drugged puppet art.

00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:39.870
It can indeed boost one's power

00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:41.010
for a short time.

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:43.770
But the general's boy likely didn't know

00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:44.700
about the backlash.

00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:46.700
He was probably set up.

00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:49.460
So I traced his movements.

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:51.250
I found that a month ago,

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:53.810
he kept visiting Doom Abyss in the Ghost Market.

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:55.420
The Ghost Market

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:56.940
is actually just Tianqi's

00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:59.050
best-known black market,

00:19:59.350 --> 00:20:00.660
a mixed crowd,

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:02.770
a gray zone at best.

00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:05.380
Without connections, you can't get in.

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:06.730
Even its hours

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:07.860
are hard to catch.

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:09.460
However,

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:11.220
as far as I know,

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:14.180
it opens once today.

00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:17.180
Good.

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:23.570
Notify Xuewei now.

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:28.070
Bravo!

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:41.050
Since entering Tianqi,

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:42.420
I've wanted to see the Ghost Market.

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:45.250
They say it's a place of monsters and ghosts.

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:47.010
I wonder how it compares to Blood River.

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:48.900
Didn't expect this wish

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:49.660
would come true today.

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:51.700
What a coincidence.

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:53.420
All I've ever wanted

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:54.700
was to take you here.

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:56.570
Then why not sooner?

00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:58.220
Now we need someone else to bring us in.

00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:01.570
After all, we're strangers

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:02.490
in Tianqi.

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:04.050
We need the right connections.

00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:06.090
Am I right,

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:07.010
Xuanwu Guardian?

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:20.140
Yumo,

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:21.140
I'll go with you!

00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:23.530
Hey, that's not how we're grouped!

00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:27.420
Looks like, same as me,

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:29.250
you're not very welcome.

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:34.770
Who's like you?

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:36.250
Everyone,

00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:39.170
long time no see.

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:45.980
Try some snacks.

00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:57.220
One for me.

00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:58.290
Me too.

00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:01.270
- Thanks. - Much obliged.

00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:07.160
That's it!

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:08.620
Not bad!

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:18.220
Recently,

00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:20.140
Li Zhengqi passed the Golden Throne prelims,

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:21.490
then soon fell ill.

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:22.460
A friend of mine

00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:23.700
works at their manor.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.090
He says he's gone mad.

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:29.090
Are these pills really safe to take?

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:31.170
Of course.

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:35.460
Take one after every two meals,

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:37.250
ten pills in a row.

00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:39.100
In fifteen days,

00:22:39.170 --> 00:22:40.480
your body will be

00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:42.500
as good as reborn.

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:45.140
Forget the Golden Throne Contest,

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:48.090
you might even win first place

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.940
in next year's martial exam.

00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:53.140
That magical?

00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:55.460
Then why did he end up like that?

00:22:57.880 --> 00:22:58.770
Because...

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.330
he rushed it.

00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:04.620
He feared he'd fail the prelims

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:07.660
and downed all three pills I gave him

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:10.090
on the eve of the bout.

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:14.940
Even so, today,

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:17.730
I'll give each of you five pills.

00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:19.900
I hope you all

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:23.220
won't do anything that stupid.

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:25.710
- Of course not. - Never.

00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:32.470
This time it's in the bag.

00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:33.060
Yeah.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.730
With this, the martial exam's nothing.

00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:38.710
- Yeah. - Yeah.

00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:41.130
Great.

00:23:48.790 --> 00:23:50.860
How did Sikong Changfeng rope you in?

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:53.010
Since you're here,

00:23:53.550 --> 00:23:54.700
why not a rematch?

00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:58.250
A true lady stays silent

00:23:58.510 --> 00:23:59.290
when others are reading.

00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:01.490
He says there's a tough endgame

00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:02.660
and asked me to take a look.

00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:06.220
A fine game indeed.

00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:08.330
So I seek answers in the books.

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:09.900
Nonsense.

00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:23.280
[Your father's in peril on Mount Luolei. I'm heading there.]

00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:23.940
[Tianqi City is in turmoil.]

00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:25.140
[If a Sword Deity lends aid, I'll rest easy. Please help.]

00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:28.570
What is it?

00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:32.010
I thought at your Xueyue City,

00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:32.770
atop Mount Cang,

00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:34.330
nothing worldly would trouble the heart.

00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:36.900
Seems as long as we live,

00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:38.380
wherever we flee,

00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:40.420
we can't escape being disturbed.

00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:45.530
My mother left Tianqi

00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:46.730
to aid my father.

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:48.330
The Prince of Langya

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:50.030
is in poor health

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:51.900
and may have no guards at hand.

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:54.180
So you're heading to Tianqi?

00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:57.420
I don't like that city,

00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:00.010
but it seems I have to go.

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:05.780
My mother wrote

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:07.380
that with a Sword Deity's help,

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:08.850
she'd have no worries.

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:10.660
- So, will you... - Hold.

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:12.940
Say no more.

00:25:15.970 --> 00:25:17.240
In literary terms,

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:18.660
your mother's letter is just flowery praise.

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:20.620
In the end,

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:21.490
it was meant to move you.

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:24.570
Let's make a bet.

00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:26.660
If I win,

00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:28.090
you'll go to Tianqi.

00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:30.380
I'll lend you the Luoshui City Lord's collection

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:31.290
to read.

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.250
If I lose,

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:35.900
I'll go instead

00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:37.660
and take up my mother's charge.

00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:41.220
Bet on what?

00:25:44.270 --> 00:25:45.380
How about plucking leaves with sword energy?

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:48.770
Mount Cang has plenty of flowers.

00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:50.380
Let's see,

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:51.810
within one stick of incense,

00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:53.010
how many petals

00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:54.330
we each can pluck.

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:55.940
Most wins.

00:26:58.440 --> 00:26:59.900
So I'm alive after all.

00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:13.810
Miracle physician,

00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:14.860
you're awake!

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:18.180
Have a seat.

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:31.090
Your wounds are grave.

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:32.700
Don't move around.

00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:34.180
Look at you...

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:36.140
Are you the miracle physician or am I?

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:45.330
Master!

00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:47.140
How can you be out of bed?

00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:48.090
Take care of yourself!

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:50.180
Are you the master or am I?

00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:52.730
You're all talking

00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:54.290
awfully bold today.

00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:55.570
Master,

00:27:56.030 --> 00:27:56.860
you're almost dead

00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:57.940
and still bragging.

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:00.460
Please drink your medicine.

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:03.250
Did you treat

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:04.490
my wounds,

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:05.140
Zhaoyan?

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:08.250
Just now,

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:09.490
I felt the wound.

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:10.770
The bandaging

00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:12.330
could use some improvement.

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:16.530
I am lacking.

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:19.220
Don't say that.

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:20.730
When I was hit,

00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:22.460
I thought I was done for.

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:24.490
In Tianqi City,

00:28:24.790 --> 00:28:26.980
finding a physician to fix this

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:28.050
isn't easy.

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:31.490
You're impressive!

00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:53.330
You...

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:54.860
Give me your hand.

00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:11.330
Master,

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:12.870
to draw those experts away

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:13.900
and safeguard us,

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:15.570
Muyu stormed the grand general's manor

00:29:16.030 --> 00:29:17.180
and suffered severe internal injuries.

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:18.980
Lately,

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:19.810
he's been recovering.

00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:21.490
I prescribed some medicine,

00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:23.220
but I'm not sure if it's right.

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:25.220
Master, will you take a look?

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:30.220
It's not about internal injuries.

00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:35.730
I trust your work.

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:37.180
Treating internal wounds

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:38.940
was the first thing I taught you.

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:41.090
If even that goes wrong,

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:43.330
you'd be expelled from Medicine King Valley.

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:47.140
All right,

00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:48.570
I should rest.

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:49.810
You may go out.

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:57.180
Master,

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000
we're staying at Ms. Wan'er's place now.

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:01.140
Thing is,

00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:02.380
there aren't many rooms.

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:04.050
All patients have to stay here.

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:05.900
Muyu needs rest too.

00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:07.530
So he...

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:09.730
has to sleep here as well.

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:17.860
Where... will he sleep?

00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:19.090
He'll sleep...

00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:20.810
in the next room.

00:30:28.030 --> 00:30:29.250
You may step out now.

00:30:55.550 --> 00:30:56.490
Su Muyu,

00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:57.980
are you...

00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:00.050
hiding something from me?

00:31:03.270 --> 00:31:04.140
You're no longer

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:05.090
Blood River's Kui,

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:07.180
nor a wandering ghost

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:08.090
of No-Sword City.

00:31:08.790 --> 00:31:09.770
Whatever it is,

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:11.380
you can

00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:13.090
and should tell me.

00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:16.140
When I took your pulse,

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:17.530
I found

00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:19.900
you could go into deviation at any time.

00:31:20.550 --> 00:31:21.250
Do you realize that?

00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:26.770
As expected, I can't hide it from you.

00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:28.860
Was it to save me

00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:30.570
that you did this?

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:32.050
I promised

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:33.900
to keep you safe.

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:35.570
That promise

00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:37.570
was back in Jiuxiao City.

00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:39.290
Is that so?

00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:43.810
I thought that promise

00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:45.980
still stood.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.770
You're in real danger now.

00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:50.420
In Wushuang City,

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:51.570
we all saw

00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:52.530
Jian Wudi's state.

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:54.050
Once in deviation,

00:31:54.550 --> 00:31:55.380
power may surge,

00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:58.180
but it burns one's life away.

00:31:58.830 --> 00:31:59.530
Don't worry.

00:32:00.030 --> 00:32:00.860
I know my limits.

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:02.530
I won't let myself

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:03.700
reach that point.

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:05.660
However,

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:08.090
about my condition,

00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:10.700
please don't tell Yumo and the others.

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:13.180
Things are perilous enough,

00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:15.420
no need to worry them.

00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:16.770
All right.

00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:18.770
But Su Muyu,

00:32:20.550 --> 00:32:21.980
remember this...

00:32:24.510 --> 00:32:25.460
no bravado.

00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:28.380
Of course no.

00:32:49.270 --> 00:32:50.700
The Mu family's messenger butterfly

00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:52.330
is exquisitely made.

00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:57.200
[Qingyang, Xuewei, Yumo, and the Xuanwu Guardian]

00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:58.300
[are investigating the Ghost Market. Note from Su Muyu]

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:02.770
Looks like

00:33:03.270 --> 00:33:04.490
I judged him right.

00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:07.220
This head of Blood River's Su family

00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:09.180
is worthy of trust.

00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:10.860
Then,

00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:12.660
it's time

00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:14.730
to see them again.

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:17.330
All right.

00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:18.010
Let's go.

00:33:18.030 --> 00:33:18.730
- Let's go. - Let's go.

00:33:20.790 --> 00:33:21.490
Keep the pills safe.

00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:27.490
- My pills! - My pills!

00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:30.860
Who's there?

00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:40.250
Xuanwu Guardian Tang Lianyue!

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:42.380
- Move! - Move!

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:43.380
No one runs!

00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:47.050
I hear in Tianqi City,

00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:48.090
when the Four Guardians handle a case,

00:33:48.510 --> 00:33:50.220
even the grand chancellor must cooperate.

00:33:50.790 --> 00:33:52.010
Gentlemen, didn't you hear him?

00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:53.860
No one leaves.

00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:55.140
Get them! Go!

00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:56.420
- Go! - Go!

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:00.250
Don't kill them.

00:34:01.030 --> 00:34:02.290
That's a bit hard.

00:34:02.550 --> 00:34:03.270
Move!

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:06.770
Quit staring! Move!

00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:08.090
Hurry!

00:34:08.210 --> 00:34:08.870
Leave it!

00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:09.570
This way!

00:34:09.670 --> 00:34:10.180
Quick!

00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:12.780
What are you waiting for?

00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:15.530
Are you just watching?

00:34:24.710 --> 00:34:26.010
Winds howl, the longbow sings.

00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:27.860
A general rides the killing field.

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:29.490
Facing you

00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:30.260
on the battlefield,

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:32.170
I'd fear you some.

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:34.020
But within this space,

00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:36.900
let's see if my Tang Clan's hidden weapons

00:34:37.630 --> 00:34:38.940
are faster than your arrows!

00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:41.690
Watch out!

00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:48.050
Senior!

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:53.570
What "senior"?

00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:55.420
He's here to take your life!

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:04.170
Tang Lianyue!

00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:05.340
Don't touch him!
