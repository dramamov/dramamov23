[Episode 34]

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.930
Tang Lianyue!

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.930
Don't touch him!

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:53.180
That was too dangerous.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:54.260
Our opponents are tough.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.030
We should retreat for now.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:56.490
- But... - Let's go!

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.130
You were hit by his Poison Palm.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.010
Even if you're the Xuanwu Guardian,

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.100
there's no way you can resume the fight.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:12.260
Let's retreat for now.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:13.290
We'll think of something later.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.850
Xuanwu Guardian of Tianqi City...

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.260
He's extraordinary indeed.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.340
He would've taken my life

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.380
if you guys were one step later.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.980
Don't you agree?

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.730
You would've died long ago

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.660
had he used his hidden weapons.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.130
If so, why didn't he use them?

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.890
Tang Lianyue is very intelligent.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.660
He found out about the identities

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:52.730
of the people here.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.890
He guessed that we came here

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.610
to deal with Prince of Langya.

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.100
If he killed any of us

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.060
and left his hidden weapons here during the process,

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:01.450
perhaps

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:02.660
it would become an indication

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.290
that he was after Prince of Langya.

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:10.850
What should we do with them, then?

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.980
Everyone,

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:18.730
please leave for now.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.850
I'll send my men to notify you all

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:22.690
about the new gathering spot later.

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.500
Let's hurry.

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:44.410
Prince of Langya.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.220
Master Su.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.410
Master Su, please don't worry.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.260
No one tracked me on my way here.

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:53.500
No one would know

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.340
that you guys are here.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.850
Your Highness, your mentor is Mr. Li of the Academy.

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:58.570
You were renowned for

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.220
your martial arts long ago.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:01.980
I have no cause to worry about.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:03.690
Your Highness, people once called you

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:04.980
the Elegant Gentleman.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.260
Your wits and intellect are second to none.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.660
And, your cunningness knows no bounds.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:11.380
Indeed.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.660
You were only willing to put your complete trust in me

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.980
after I risked my life in our duel.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.340
Within Tianqi City,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.610
even a person

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:20.610
like me

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.930
has to walk every step

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:23.730
as if I'm walking on thin ice.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.340
Therefore,

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:26.810
I can't afford to make mistakes.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.780
Master Su,

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.780
I'm sorry.

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:31.490
I heard from Second Master

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.930
that the situation at Nanjue was critical.

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.140
Guardian Azure Dragon and the elite soldiers under your rule

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:37.810
have already gone there to assist them.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.580
Guardian White Tiger was nowhere to be found.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.700
Guardian Vermilion Bird, Sikong Changfeng,

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.580
returned to the martial world many years ago.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:46.580
Right now,

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.020
only Tang Lianyue is assisting you.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.050
This should be

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.220
your weakest position

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.930
ever since you helped your brother

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.930
to obtain the throne.

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.730
Master Su,

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:56.980
it seems

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.580
you understand the situation here

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.250
very well.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.900
Of course, some of them were coincidences.

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.610
For example, Lei Mengsha got himself trapped.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:07.700
However, for some of them,

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.900
I suppose you did them on purpose.

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:13.700
You made yourself look weak on purpose.

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:15.900
What are you waiting for?

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:24.610
My opponents

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:25.810
will only strike

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:27.660
when they think I'm weak enough.

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:29.850
And, what I desire

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:31.100
is for them

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:32.340
to strike me.

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:34.850
By then, you'll require my help.

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:36.250
Indeed.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:38.930
By then,

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:40.660
I'll still be very weak.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.250
I'll be so weak

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:43.540
that I can't even

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:44.220
protect myself.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:45.980
Therefore, Master Su,

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.220
I require your help

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:48.460
for certain matters.

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:50.050
Now that I'm looking at it,

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:53.900
was Blood River's arrival in Tianqi City

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:56.740
a move you planned

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.580
long ago?

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.250
I cannot plan a move that far ahead.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.410
I was merely following the flow.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.660
However, regarding my promise to you,

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:09.100
I'll definitely

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:10.340
keep it.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:11.930
All right.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.490
All those who were struck by the puppet poison

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:19.170
were people of Tianqi City

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:20.610
who possessed military strength.

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:22.930
With this leverage,

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.460
even if I have no control over them,

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.170
they won't dare to act recklessly.

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:29.460
Yong,

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:31.700
I'll tell you this one last time.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:32.900
Once you make this choice,

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:35.020
there's no turning back.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:38.540
Uncle,

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:41.370
I never turn back.

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:46.140
For all that you see when you turn back

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.100
is unbearable.

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:01.050
Mother!

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:03.370
Mother,

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:04.930
are you okay?

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.610
Why are you still doing such needlework?

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:09.540
I'm fine.

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:11.900
It only pricked my finger. I'm not bleeding.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:13.730
Look.

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.140
Your father loves

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.370
the needlework I make.

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:18.410
I made him a belt

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.170
since I had nothing to do.

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:22.140
And, I made a pair of winter boots for your uncle

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:23.340
and grandfather each.

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:24.290
Come, sit here.

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:27.460
Why are you here today?

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:29.580
Was schoolwork difficult for you?

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:30.540
Not at all.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:32.580
My teacher even praised me for my intellect.

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:33.780
When Father heard about it,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.410
he granted me a set of scholar's tools.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:37.250
There's no school today.

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:39.020
That's why I came back to visit you.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:40.700
Good boy.

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:42.580
Will Father be coming here today?

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:48.660
Perhaps.

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:52.140
Your Highness,

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:53.980
please make a plea on Her Highness's behalf.

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.410
Now, His Majesty visits Consort Xuan every day.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.250
It's been so long since he visited us.

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:00.460
You're his first child.

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:02.460
His Majesty doted on you the most in the past.

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:03.610
- You should... - Diancui!

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:05.220
That was unnecessary.

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.220
Pay no heed to her words.

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:12.540
Study well

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:13.900
and make me proud.

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:18.540
Your Highness!

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:19.980
Your Highness, we're in trouble!

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:21.610
Your Highness,

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:23.370
there's something wrong with the Ministry of Revenue's accounts,

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:24.460
which were under Lord Dian's supervision.

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:25.340
His Majesty is enraged.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:26.460
He intends to punish him!

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:35.380
[Dian's Residence]

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:39.980
[Dian's Residence]

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:44.850
I suppose your father still has a conscience.

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:47.730
He merely ordered your grandfather to retire.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:49.130
Perhaps

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:51.530
Father was lenient with him

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:53.180
as Mother belonged to the Dian family.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:54.610
I suppose he wouldn't bother

00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:56.940
to finish off a lone stray dog.

00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:59.490
But Yong, don't worry.

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:00.940
I'm joining the military

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.100
to fork out a new path

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:03.100
for our family.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.340
I will become your new source of strength.

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:06.890
You must look after your mother

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:08.580
in Tianqi.

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:45.420
Yong,

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.300
you're the only kin

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:49.820
I have.

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:54.490
Uncle, you're also

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:57.180
the only blade I can hold

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:00.770
without injuring myself.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:04.530
Your Highness,

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:06.490
Xuanwu Guardian and the members of Blood River

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:08.180
have headed to Doom Abyss together.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.010
Blood River again?

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:12.650
Su Changhe already agreed to

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:13.610
join hands with us.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:15.940
Why is Blood River

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.730
still obstructing us from executing our plans?

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:22.250
Haoyue.

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:24.100
Go and find Su Changhe.

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:26.130
If he continues to be on his retreat,

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:27.940
our cooperation

00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:30.180
will be called off.

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:32.130
By then, we shall

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.100
eradicate

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.610
every single Blood River member

00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:38.460
in Tianqi City.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:39.940
Yes, Your Highness.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:40.980
Your Highness.

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:46.730
Why don't you send me there?

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:49.010
After all, if you trace back to our roots,

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:50.820
I suppose I'm a part of them as well.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:53.340
That'll do.

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:54.610
Besides that,

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.180
try to locate

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.180
the current hiding spot of Su Muyu and his men.

00:10:58.550 --> 00:10:59.300
You may eradicate them

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:01.610
without notifying Su Changhe

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:05.580
when it's necessary.

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:11.490
How did it go?

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:13.580
Yu,

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:15.370
we've already found out about the secret

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:16.220
behind the drugged puppets in Tianqi City.

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:17.610
However, our opponents were too strong.

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:18.490
We had no choice but to retreat.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:19.890
Yumo and Tang Lianyue

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.490
have already returned to Prince of Langya's Manor to report back.

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:22.580
Su Muyu,

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:23.850
we should leave for now.

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:25.700
The situation in Tianqi City is much more complicated than we thought.

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:26.770
I don't think

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:28.220
this is worth it.

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:41.100
Xuewei,

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:42.340
go and ask Changli

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:44.180
about Changhe's retreat.

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:46.220
Yu,

00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:48.100
do you intend to give up as well?

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:49.700
I don't want people

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:51.490
to use Blood River as a political tool.

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.460
You guys may leave with Miss Bai first.

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.420
I'll wait for Changhe's news.

00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:58.220
We'll return to Blood River

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.130
after I rendezvous with him.

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:01.850
Yu,

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:04.220
you're still the same.

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:05.700
You don't know how to lie at all.

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:10.060
You want us to take Miss Bai with us

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:11.850
while you'll clean up the mess yourself.

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:14.100
I can't afford to leave.

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:17.420
Miss Bai.

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:18.700
Why is that the case?

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:20.650
Tianqi City is facing turmoil

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:21.530
due to the drugged puppets.

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:23.300
And, the puppet spell was developed by

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:25.820
an outcast of Medicine King Valley.

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:28.730
Right now, I have the highest seniority among its members.

00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:30.300
I can't just leave without doing anything.

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:33.010
But now,

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:34.530
the Patriarch is on a reclusive retreat.

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:35.850
Master Su

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:36.850
is also heavily wounded.

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:38.220
With our strength,

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:39.850
I'm afraid we won't be able to contribute much

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:41.340
on this battlefield.

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:45.890
Who said so?

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:46.730
Fadog?

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:51.980
Fadog.

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:52.770
Uncle Zhe.

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:56.370
I'm here for you, my girl.

00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:59.300
Who actually wounded you?

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:01.490
I'm going to rip him to shreds.

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:03.850
Fadog, you're too late.

00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:05.580
Su Muyu

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:07.580
already avenged me.

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:11.300
You brat.

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:12.530
Good job.

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:18.730
Your Highness.

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:23.340
Ms. Yumo, I've long heard of your name.

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:24.340
But this is

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:25.890
our first encounter.

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:27.730
Initially, I wanted to see you

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:28.940
when Blood River came to Tianqi.

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:30.130
It's just that...

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:31.060
It's just

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:32.180
that Lianyue wasn't around back then.

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:33.890
Therefore, there was no need to see me.

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:38.700
Your Highness, you're quite humorous.

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:39.980
Please have a seat.

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.010
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:50.010
I came from the Academy.

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:51.940
Back then, Master told us

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:53.490
that being interesting

00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:55.490
could attract girls better

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.220
than being powerful.

00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:58.820
Therefore,

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:00.340
everyone was interesting

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:01.340
in their own way.

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:03.490
Lianyue lived with the Tang Clan since young.

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:04.980
He was

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:06.340
already uninteresting

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:07.300
when he got to know us.

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:09.370
And, I couldn't change him

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:10.610
even after all these years.

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:13.180
Therefore, Ms. Yumo,

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:14.250
I wonder

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:15.650
what you like about him.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:22.820
I used to like him.

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:23.940
But now,

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:25.300
I no longer like him.

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:28.220
Why is that the case?

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:30.300
He's too timid.

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:32.130
I like bold men.

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:33.850
For example,

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:36.730
a valiant man such as yourself, Your Highness.

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:45.940
Your Highness!

00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:02.100
Ms. Yumo,

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:03.460
Lianyue is a good man

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:05.850
whom you can entrust yourself to.

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:07.060
Not me.

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:09.850
Your Highness, what do you mean?

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:12.220
It's because among the men I know,

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:13.650
Lianyue is the only man

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:15.770
who will not change a single bit

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:17.020
when he's sure

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:18.610
that he can

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:20.130
provide you

00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:22.180
with a lifetime of happiness,

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:23.340
unless he dies.

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:25.700
Only then

00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:28.220
will he dedicate his true feelings to you.

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:30.820
Other people

00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:31.770
cannot do so.

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:35.300
Your Highness,

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:37.770
this isn't the time for this.

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:41.730
Master once told me

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:44.180
that discussions of relationship

00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:45.730
are suitable

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:46.850
no matter when we initiate the conversation.

00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:48.940
The Imperial Assembly will be held soon.

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:51.060
But coincidentally, many of the sons of noblemen

00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:52.220
were struck by the puppet poison

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:53.100
at this particular timing.

00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:54.650
It's obvious

00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:57.010
that First Prince is plotting something.

00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:59.180
And, rumors about you have been circulating

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:00.820
around Tianqi City.

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:03.180
I'm sure he's targeting us.

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:07.370
Actually, I think

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:09.530
both have their own merits.

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:11.530
One of them can express his love at any time.

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:12.730
He expresses it in a direct

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:13.610
and carefree manner.

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:15.610
Therefore, it's always ferocious

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.010
at the start.

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:20.370
As for the other one, he only expresses his love

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:21.940
after everything has settled down.

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:24.300
It always feels a bit too calm.

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:27.100
Therefore, the beautiful lady has

00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:28.300
to endure more hardships.

00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:31.300
However,

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:32.460
Lianyue

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:34.340
is a great man.

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:45.490
Your Highness,

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:47.250
what's with the eccentric speech?

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:48.610
It's as if you...

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:49.220
Yumo.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:52.610
Do not spout nonsense.

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:54.730
You knew what I was going to say, didn't you?

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:56.220
If so, how can that be considered nonsense?

00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:58.820
Do you mean

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:01.490
as if I'm telling you my last will?

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:03.940
Perhaps

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:06.180
I am telling you my last will.

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:06.730
Your Highness!

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:09.810
Forget it.

00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:12.490
What did you say again?

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.900
You said many sons of noblemen

00:17:15.070 --> 00:17:16.290
were struck by the puppet poison.

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:20.660
Which family do they come from?

00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:22.290
We only managed to identify some of them.

00:17:22.830 --> 00:17:23.570
We haven't identified the rest.

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:27.530
Why did you come back, then?

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:28.420
Go and find them.

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:30.140
Find every single one of them.

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:31.390
Protect them all.

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:33.220
After that, figure out a way to neutralize the poison.

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:35.220
But remember,

00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:36.530
you must finish these operations

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:37.730
as soon as possible.

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:39.570
If not, things will go south

00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:42.090
when their fathers and brothers gather at Tianqi

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:44.220
for the Imperial Assembly.

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:46.330
Perhaps

00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:48.570
something worse will happen.

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:50.090
Understood.

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:11.090
Changhe,

00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:13.570
are we going to die here?

00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:15.140
That won't happen.

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:17.090
I'll surely take you with me

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:18.220
and escape from here.

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:20.090
What about Mother and the rest?

00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:23.330
Can we still rescue them?

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:24.530
We can.

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:27.700
Both of us will survive.

00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:34.290
Changhe.

00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:35.140
Changli?

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:36.250
Are you okay?

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:37.730
Changhe,

00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:39.140
you should go.

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:41.290
Just leave me behind.

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:44.250
I'm bleeding so much.

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:47.220
I don't think I can survive!

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:47.860
No.

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:49.290
Just go!

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:51.090
Just go!

00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:58.540
Go!

00:18:58.540 --> 00:18:59.420
Changhe!

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:01.020
Just go!

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.370
Just leave me behind!

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:04.090
Changhe!

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:05.140
Go!

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:06.180
Changli!

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:10.010
Changhe!

00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:31.140
This time,

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:34.860
we're not running away.

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:46.250
Ignorant fool,

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:49.010
it seems you have a death wish.

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.220
Who would have the nerve before the King of Hell

00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:04.380
to make me face death?

00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:17.050
Even the King of Hell

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:19.570
distances himself from me when he sees me!

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:42.730
Finally.

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:01.180
Didn't I already tell you?

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:02.860
Changhe is in a reclusive retreat.

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:04.330
No one is to enter his chamber.

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:07.570
In a reclusive retreat?

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:11.220
Your Patriarch promises to form an alliance with us.

00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:13.010
But he disappeared

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:14.220
after making the deal.

00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:16.660
And, the rest of Blood River

00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:19.180
is obstructing us from executing our plan too.

00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:21.620
It's all because

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:23.380
Changhe received a blow from Prince of Langya back then.

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:24.530
He sustained internal injury.

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:30.380
Could it be...

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:32.570
I heard

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:35.420
that every level of the Hell Palm

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:38.140
unveils a new world.

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:40.380
Once one reaches the ninth level,

00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:41.980
one can form his own world.

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:44.180
This is my first time

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:45.620
witnessing

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:47.900
a cultivator who has reached the ninth level of Hell Palm.

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:51.770
It's you, old man.

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:57.700
Patriarch of Blood River,

00:21:58.270 --> 00:22:00.050
we have met again.

00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:04.980
It seems you guys joined First Prince's faction

00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:06.250
after leaving Shadow Sect.

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:12.250
I knew I had the right mindset back then.

00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:13.660
I should've gotten rid of

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:15.290
all my opponents.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:16.810
I wonder

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:18.380
if Muyu would regret his decision

00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:20.220
if he could see this.

00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:22.730
If we wish

00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:24.700
to remain in Tianqi for a long time,

00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:27.980
we have to find a worthy master to depend on.

00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:30.070
His Highness

00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:31.620
is quite a good option.

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:32.730
If not,

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.180
why would you and I

00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:35.860
encounter each other

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:36.700
here?

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:37.570
What do you think?

00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:41.050
Now that the deed is over,

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:44.660
the Three Families of Tianqi

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.010
and Blood River

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:49.140
are willing to acknowledge you as the Patriarch.

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:51.860
Once His Highness ascends the throne,

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:55.140
we shall replace

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:56.570
the current Inner Security Division

00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:59.730
and walk in the sunlight officially.

00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:03.900
Let's go.

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:07.490
It's been quite some time since I last met His Highness.

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:09.530
Now that I've reached

00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:10.860
the ninth level of Hell Palm,

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:13.460
I wonder who will

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:15.530
be the first

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:16.620
to have a taste of it.

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:28.010
Lianyue was meant to live beneath

00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:31.290
the open skies of the martial world.

00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:35.490
Does one become more talkative

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:37.330
as they accumulate more life experiences?

00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:39.900
You're the same as Sikong Changfeng.

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:41.290
You two like to express your sentiments

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:42.900
while admiring a gorgeous view.

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:48.140
You and I have plucked the same number of flowers and leaves.

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:50.570
But among your harvest,

00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:53.460
there are three pieces of peach blossom leaves.

00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:55.940
Therefore,

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:57.730
you've lost.

00:23:58.920 --> 00:23:59.530
Forget it.

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:02.700
Deliver this message to Sikong Changfeng on my behalf.

00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:04.660
I'm going to head to Tianqi.

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:06.490
I'm not sure when I'll return.

00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:11.900
I suppose the life I was leading

00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:13.570
was too restrained.

00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:15.090
That's why I'm feeling sentimental

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:16.770
now that it has come to this.

00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:18.900
I suppose a life like yours

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:20.460
is great.

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:22.220
You lead a carefree life.

00:24:24.550 --> 00:24:26.290
Your mother sent you here to protect me in secret.

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:27.940
Sorry for the trouble.

00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:32.050
So, do you regret the decision you made?

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:45.620
If, one day,

00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:47.250
you encounter an expert,

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:49.810
and you have a chance to challenge him to a duel,

00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:52.490
but you'll fail and won't be able to wield the sword again

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:54.770
if you challenge him.

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:57.530
Will you regret the fact

00:24:58.110 --> 00:24:59.420
that you challenged him to a duel?

00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:01.250
I won't.

00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:08.220
That is also my answer.

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:11.180
Life is just like the Peach Blossom Coin

00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:13.290
used for divination on Mount Wangcheng.

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:15.490
Only one side can face upward.

00:25:16.270 --> 00:25:18.010
If I want to lead a serene life,

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:20.330
I have to cast away the carefree martial world life.

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:22.770
If you wish to experience peerless swordsmanship,

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:26.380
you have to bear the consequences of challenging him.

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:28.570
That's frustrating.

00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:30.290
What I meant was

00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:32.530
I won't lose to him.

00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:40.220
If so,

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:41.810
I shall head to Pleasure House first.

00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:44.290
Beauty,

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:45.730
I'll go and enjoy your performance again when I'm free.

00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:48.810
Sir, I'll surely reserve a good seat

00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:49.660
for you.

00:25:58.070 --> 00:25:58.530
Boss.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:03.700
You guys are here as well.

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:05.900
You instructed Patriarch to tell us

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:06.980
that we no longer need to be

00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:08.220
the masked Twelve Zodiacs.

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:09.570
But fighting by your side

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:11.180
is something exciting.

00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:12.460
Therefore,

00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:13.660
we've returned.

00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:18.180
Your new blade looks great.

00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:22.090
I retrieved this from Yellow Springs Pawnshop.

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:24.010
It cuts through iron like butter.

00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:26.090
Boss,

00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:26.980
don't worry.

00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:28.090
Our martial arts

00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:29.420
have improved quite a lot as well.

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:38.380
Could we leave Tianqi City right now

00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:41.050
if we didn't listen to that lass?

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:43.900
If it's possible,

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:47.530
Uncle Zhe, I hope you can take Miss Bai with you.

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:50.290
As for the affairs of Tianqi City,

00:26:51.550 --> 00:26:52.730
allow Changhe and me to deal with them.

00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:06.980
If that's the case,

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:09.090
I don't think it'll work.

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:12.700
Look at your current state.

00:27:13.270 --> 00:27:14.140
What do you think you can do?

00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:16.860
If you don't want your body

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:18.770
to be riddled with holes, just like mine,

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:20.420
the best way is for you

00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:22.140
to stop using martial arts

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:24.140
and rest and recuperate under my daughter's care

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:25.380
for a few months.

00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:27.700
Only then will you be able to recover completely.

00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:29.700
I'll try to recover as soon as possible.

00:27:30.790 --> 00:27:31.700
Uncle Zhe, please don't worry.

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:34.380
How could I?

00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:36.620
You and I suffered the same type of injury.

00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:38.900
I could tell this at first glance.

00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:40.860
The current you is...

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:45.940
If a breeze were to come right now,

00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:47.940
you'll dissipate like

00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:48.660
the incense smoke.

00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:51.660
Uncle Zhe, not only did you survive,

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:53.570
but you also retained

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:54.730
your reign as the top martial artist of Su family.

00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:57.330
I know this better than you.

00:28:04.790 --> 00:28:05.770
If the current me

00:28:07.030 --> 00:28:09.620
has to fight with my all,

00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:12.860
if I have to fight with someone on equal terms as I,

00:28:13.510 --> 00:28:14.900
I'll surely die from it.

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:17.220
That's the consequence of the grave injury

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:18.940
I sustained back then.

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:21.140
Even Xin Baicao

00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:22.770
won't be able to treat my condition.

00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:27.810
I wish

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:29.730
to entrust my daughter to you in the future.

00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:32.770
Therefore, I don't want you to end up like me.

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:35.770
Uncle Zhe.

00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:39.140
I have my own plans.

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:41.980
My foot!

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:46.050
Your final plan

00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:47.900
is to forfeit your own life.

00:28:48.550 --> 00:28:49.420
If she gets together with someone like you,

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:51.180
she'll become a widow in the end.

00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:55.330
But I suppose we don't have a choice.

00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:57.730
That's the person you are.

00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:00.290
That's why you're Su Muyu.

00:29:04.790 --> 00:29:05.810
Since both you and my daughter

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:07.810
have already decided,

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:09.290
let me

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:11.460
do you a favor.

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:14.290
Uncle Zhe, you mustn't.

00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:15.620
Why not?

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:21.380
If you use this art,

00:29:21.790 --> 00:29:23.250
you'll receive a serious backlash!

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:24.090
Don't worry.

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:25.620
I won't die yet.

00:29:26.270 --> 00:29:27.460
I'll live on

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:28.940
so that I can look after my daughter.

00:29:31.550 --> 00:29:32.180
Su Muyu.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:33.940
You don't have a choice.

00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:35.660
You have to accept my zhenqi.

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:37.810
If not, I'll die

00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:39.530
from exhausting all of my zhenqi.

00:29:57.310 --> 00:29:57.940
Su Muyu,

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.140
once you overcome this ordeal,

00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:03.570
you should leave the martial world.

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:06.490
Leave the martial world?

00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:08.220
For example,

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:09.980
you can return to Nan'an City.

00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:12.940
You can be a medical apprentice for the rest of your life.

00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:14.730
You can help my daughter

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:16.010
to sell,

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:17.050
crush,

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:17.980
and brew herbs.

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:21.220
Once the sun sets,

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:23.810
you can make a bowl

00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:25.530
of terrible noodles for her.

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:29.330
After that, my daughter

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:30.900
will reprimand you

00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:32.730
while she finishes the noodles.

00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:34.420
You will

00:30:35.030 --> 00:30:35.810
feel embarrassed over it.

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:37.380
The next morning,

00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:39.010
you'll go and buy osmanthus cakes for her.

00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:42.180
Don't you think

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:44.010
that's pretty nice?

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:48.250
I can't just make terrible noodles for her

00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:49.140
for the rest of my life.

00:30:51.550 --> 00:30:52.660
I'm sure you like it as well.

00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:54.980
I can live in Nan'an City.

00:30:56.550 --> 00:30:57.620
I can lead a peaceful life there.

00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:01.250
But what about the members of Blood River?

00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:05.810
If they are allowed to roam free across the martial world,

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:09.140
they'll eventually die

00:31:12.030 --> 00:31:13.460
where no one can find them.

00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:18.140
You're a responsible man.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.090
Uncle Zhe, I believe

00:31:20.110 --> 00:31:21.330
that you were once a responsible man as well.

00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:24.140
After all, you're the former Kui.

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:26.290
And, you're from the main family.

00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:29.010
You were supposed to inherit the title of Patriarch.

00:31:30.110 --> 00:31:31.050
I guess so.

00:31:32.270 --> 00:31:33.140
Back then,

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:35.700
I had lofty aspirations.

00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:37.700
I merely wanted

00:31:37.790 --> 00:31:38.940
to make my name known throughout the world.

00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:41.730
I wanted to fight for the world's number one title.

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:44.330
What happened after that?

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:45.660
After that,

00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:50.380
I found love.

00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:52.420
Since then, I have only wished

00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:53.860
to leave the martial world

00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:55.330
and lead a secluded life with her.

00:31:56.350 --> 00:31:57.250
Blood River,

00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:58.530
and the martial world,

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:01.480
none of them was as enticing as

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:02.900
watching a sky full of stars with her.

00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:04.380
You're inferior

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:06.180
to me.

00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:07.980
It seems like

00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:09.660
I'm the best man

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:10.730
in the world.

00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:16.620
Fadog,

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:17.730
what are you doing?

00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:23.090
This should be the Divine-Demon Nirvana Art.

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:24.530
Rumor has it

00:32:25.270 --> 00:32:25.810
that when one

00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:26.700
has sustained grave injuries,

00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:28.140
they can exchange their life for another.

00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:29.810
Although it has been modified,

00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:31.700
and the user won't die from it,

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:32.620
the user

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.330
will receive a serious backlash.

00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:37.250
Uncle Zhe has truly given his all

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:39.860
for Su Muyu's sake.

00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:57.900
I heard that Tianqi City hasn't been peaceful

00:32:58.680 --> 00:32:59.620
recently.

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:03.420
Assassins attacked Flying Tiger General's Residence at night.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.490
It was quite the commotion.

00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:07.490
Dian Ye?

00:33:08.830 --> 00:33:10.330
Who has he offended?

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:11.770
I have

00:33:12.510 --> 00:33:13.770
no idea.

00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:15.730
I think

00:33:16.510 --> 00:33:17.860
it's some martial artists.

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:21.570
Martial artists, huh?

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:26.460
If that's the case,

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.700
shouldn't we ask Ruofeng about it?

00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:32.050
It seems those martial artists

00:33:33.030 --> 00:33:36.010
are Prince of Langya's acquaintances.

00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:42.420
Martial artists like them

00:33:43.550 --> 00:33:45.140
actually dared to attack a general

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:46.700
in Tianqi, huh?

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:51.220
They're too bold for their own good.

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:52.860
Relay my order to Dian Ye.

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:54.660
I'm granting him permission

00:33:55.030 --> 00:33:56.620
to conduct a citywide manhunt for the assassins.

00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:59.730
He can dispatch as many of the elite troops under him.

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:01.900
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:04.420
Now, I've reached the ninth level

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:05.810
of Hell Palm.

00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:08.010
It feels as if the vast world

00:34:08.070 --> 00:34:09.210
is but the size of my palm now.

00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:11.050
By the way, old man,

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:13.820
were you unable

00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:15.740
to reach the ninth level of Hell Palm

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:17.010
even after all these years?

00:34:19.150 --> 00:34:20.530
The Hell Palm the Three Families of Tianqi practices

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:22.690
is different from the one

00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:25.610
you guys are practicing.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.820
The arts and manuals we have

00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:28.740
are incomplete.

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:31.130
We can only reach the eighth level at most.

00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:33.170
Even if you and I were on the same level,

00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:35.210
I will be inferior to you.

00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:36.940
I see.

00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:38.940
I thought

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:39.900
you were merely ungifted.

00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:45.420
I suppose that's correct as well.

00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:47.610
But Patriarch,

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:48.650
do you know why

00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:50.530
the Three Families of Tianqi

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:52.090
only have incomplete arts

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:53.340
and manuals?

00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:54.820
Please tell me about it.

00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:57.420
It's because Hell Palm

00:34:57.420 --> 00:34:59.490
is a sinister art.

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:00.650
Those who reach the highest level

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:02.210
will receive a serious backlash.

00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:04.940
Therefore, the manuals

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:05.940
we had in Tianqi City

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.170
were modified.

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:08.820
We cannot utilize

00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:09.780
all of their power.

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:11.650
As for those in Blood River,

00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:14.050
the original copy was kept within your organization

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:16.900
in order to seek out more power.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.130
Long time no see,

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:29.820
Patriarch.

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:32.170
Do you know

00:35:32.710 --> 00:35:34.460
what happened when you were away

00:35:35.230 --> 00:35:36.210
on your reclusive retreat?

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:38.050
I heard that my friends at Blood River

00:35:38.110 --> 00:35:38.980
almost died.

00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:42.210
The head of Su family almost died as well.

00:35:43.070 --> 00:35:44.340
As for He-Yu Clinic,

00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:45.980
it was almost leveled overnight.

00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:48.050
Do you guys know

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:49.940
that I'm furious right now?

00:35:51.590 --> 00:35:53.010
It's all because you all were messing around.

00:35:53.070 --> 00:35:53.650
Messing around?

00:35:56.030 --> 00:35:56.780
Sir Zhuo Qing,

00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:58.570
say, what if I mess around

00:35:58.670 --> 00:36:00.070
and kill the prince in front of me

00:36:00.070 --> 00:36:01.050
with one blow?

00:36:01.630 --> 00:36:02.460
Will you be able to stop me?

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:05.420
Such audacity!

00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:14.300
If it were the past version of you,

00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:17.010
there was no way you could achieve that.

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:19.690
However, if it's the current you we're talking about,

00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:23.210
there's a 50% chance

00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:25.530
you'll be able to take Yong's life.

00:36:27.110 --> 00:36:28.340
Should I give it a try?
