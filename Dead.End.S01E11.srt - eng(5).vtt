Yes.

I can't let that happen.

what I would have done

into me just now.

I'm a police officer.

No.

You're a cop,

how to properly hold someone.

Look,

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:39.630
you should do it like this.

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:40.750
You need to put your hands

00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:42.240
on her upper back.

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:43.670
You need to pat her back,

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:44.670
and then gently tell her,

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:46.530
"It's okay. It's okay."

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:47.390
You need to say something

00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:48.390
to comfort me.

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:49.460
It will be fine.

It will be fine.

It will be fine.

It's all right.

I'm fine. Go ahead with your work.

You won't go looking for her again,
will you?

Don't worry. I won't.

There's a cut below the collarbone.

How tall is she?

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:47.040
About 5'7" or taller.

00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:50.030
That makes sense.

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:51.360
The killer must have been

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:52.320
aiming for her neck,

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.180
but she was too tall, so he missed.

How come?

00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:24.240
He can't figure anything out.

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:25.030
He's coming.

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:26.440
I'll say the same thing even if he's here.

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:27.200

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:42.720
a group of

00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:44.790

Let me talk to the person in charge.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.100
We just want to know

00:19:59.350 --> 00:20:00.950
why you released Crazy Monk.

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:01.570
Yes.

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:02.500

-Yeah.

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:02.760
Yes.

00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:03.440
Why was he released?

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:05.440
That procedure was approved
by the prosecutor's office.

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:06.350
There wasn't enough evidence.

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:07.000
Bullshit.

00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:09.310
Insufficient evidence?

00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:10.680
Then why did you
arrest him?

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:11.490
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:12.080
Yes.

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:13.590
Insufficient evidence, really?

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:15.310
I think it's because they're close.

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:15.830
Right.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:16.960
You can't make accusations like that.

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:18.420
Am I making things up?

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:19.790
My girl has been missing for so long.

00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:21.200
Have you found her?

00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:22.160
Tell me,

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:23.720
since things are starting up again
in the hutong,

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:24.510
does this mean even fewer people

00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:25.350
will look for my daughter?

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:26.030
We're still looking for her.

00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:27.880
What have you found?

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:29.640
He just thinks Crazy Monk is rich,

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:30.960
so he was protecting him.

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:32.070
If I were protecting him,

00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:33.400
wouldn't it be better
if I hadn't arrested him at all?

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:34.160
Then ask yourself why.

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:34.790
Just listen now.

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:36.120
No, Mei, it's like this.

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:36.590
We are doing things

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:38.310
according to normal procedure.

00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:39.880
We police collect evidence,

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:40.350
and then,

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:42.200
the prosecutor's office supervises us.

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:43.000
Finally, this case

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:43.960
must go to the court

Don't touch me. Don't push me.

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:50.640
What normal procedure?

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:52.250
You're all protecting him.

00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:53.480
Ran Xi, I'm telling you,

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:54.740
we are protecting him.

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:56.550
There's no normal procedure!

00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:57.950
What exactly do you want?

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:00.550
We want a new community officer!

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:02.000
That's right.

00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:03.090
What are you doing?

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:04.030
Am I wrong?

What's going on?

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:07.100
What did I do?

00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:08.330
Did I anything wrong?

If you can't do the job, get out.

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:10.440
Look at him.

00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:11.830
Look how bad his attitude is.

00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:13.290
Did you see that? How rude!

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:14.640
Don't push me.

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:15.750
Let me tell you.

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:16.510
Did you say anything?

Did you do what I asked you to do?

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:26.720
There's another incident in our hutong.

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:27.920
I went to check it out.

00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:30.450
Did your captain ask you to go?

00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:32.100
I went on my own.

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:34.270
Nobody asked you to go,

00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:35.400
but you went anyway?

Did you deliver them?

will you deliver them or not?

00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:25.040
There was a child, seven years old.

00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:27.400
He got sick and took medicine.

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:29.000
His parents had to go to work,

00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:31.970
so they left him with the neighbors
next door

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:37.290
—an old man

00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:39.640
and a blind old woman.

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:41.720
Then at night,

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:45.860
that old man killed the child.

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:52.410
He hung the child's corpse
from the roof beam.

00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:58.960
And then he ran away.

00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:10.110
I've been hunting that old man,

00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:10.970
for many years,

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:13.240
but I just couldn't find him.

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:16.720
Someone said he appeared by the river.

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:21.360
So I often walk by the river
when I have time.

00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:23.010
It's become a habit.

00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:27.070
That was

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:29.270
my first case.

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:37.660
What happened after that?

00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:40.510
Later,

00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:42.720
I couldn't find him.

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:45.440
My mentor couldn't find him either.

00:23:45.790 --> 00:23:46.790
I asked my mentor

00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:48.200
why.

00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:50.720
My mentor said

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:54.370
solving cases is about finding clues

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:55.280
and evidence.

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:57.070
Don't ask why.

00:23:57.830 --> 00:23:58.480
If you do,

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:00.690
you'll walk into a dead end,

00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:01.890
with no way out.

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:10.200
Many things

00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:12.090
have no explanations.

00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:25.910
Even the best detectives

00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:28.170
have mysteries they can't solve.

00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:29.680
It's impossible to solve

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:30.740
every single case.

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:32.610
If we can't solve it,

00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:34.240
we have to accept it.

00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:42.160
I don't accept that.

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:44.030
I'm-

00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:46.480
not saying we should give up now

00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:48.310
or stop trying to solve the case.

00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:50.130
What I mean is

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:52.550
that we should try our best.

00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:55.000
But

00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:57.910
we also need to let go, right?

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:07.200
You can't let go yourself,
yet you're telling me to?

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:08.110
If I couldn't let go,

00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:09.590
I would still be working
as a criminal police officer.

00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:11.320
I would keep obsessing over it,

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:13.040
and I'd definitely go crazy.

00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:19.310
I've seen many police officers
who couldn't solve cases

00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:20.160
and ended up going insane.

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:21.820
There are plenty of examples.

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:23.920
I just didn't want to end up like that,

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:25.920
so I voluntarily asked to step down.

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:31.940
That's not letting go.

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:33.600
That's running away.

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:35.510
Never mind my reasons.

00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:39.640
I just want to tell you,

00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:41.550
sometimes,

00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:45.300
whether it's cases

00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:46.590
or other matters,

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:49.740
you can't obsess and struggle with them.

00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:54.440
For each case,

00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:56.440
we handle it seriously.

00:25:58.070 --> 00:25:59.920
We solve whichever ones we can.

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:02.380
Isn't that the principle?

00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:05.870
Solve whichever ones we can?

00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:10.190
But I want to
solve this particular one now.

00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:12.440
This is what we call being stubborn,

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:13.070
you know?

is that it?

There's no way out of here, you know?

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:29.750
I can walk out.

00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:40.790
Well..

00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:42.210
Well...

00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:43.960
I don't know.

00:31:44.030 --> 00:31:45.650
It was just a red dot,

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:47.310
flickering back and forth under my skirt.

00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:48.170
back and forth.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:49.930
A laser pointer.

00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:51.210
Yes.

00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:51.720
Yes.

00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:52.480
Yes.

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:53.810
A laser pointer.

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:57.310
You work at the electronics factory?

00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:58.960
What do you do there?

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:00.440
Electronic components.

00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:01.440
I test speakers

00:32:01.790 --> 00:32:02.400
by using

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:03.950
hearing aids

00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:05.960
to check if there are any unusual sounds
in the speakers.

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:07.880
Then your hearing should be excellent.

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:10.010
Yet you didn't hear anyone behind you?

00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:11.720
Yes,

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:14.310
we all have our hearing tested,

00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:16.170
and mine is exceptionally sharp.

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:17.890
He made no sound.

00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:23.160
That hutong was so quiet,

00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:26.570
is it possible he walked without a sound?

00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:28.770
He was totally silent,

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:30.920
like a ghost.

00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:40.400
Hold these documents carefully.

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:41.160
Don't leave anything behind.

00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:41.750
Wang Lei？

00:32:42.550 --> 00:32:43.030
Let's go.

00:32:43.030 --> 00:32:43.510
Okay.

00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:46.830
Zhao,

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:49.590
has the water and electricity
at home been cut off?

00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:50.270
Oh, I forgot.

00:32:50.270 --> 00:32:51.750
You live in the dormitory, right?

00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:52.270
That's perfect.

00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:53.790
Come on, go on a business trip with me.

00:32:53.790 --> 00:32:54.400
Where to?

00:32:54.550 --> 00:32:55.070
Shanxi.

00:32:56.030 --> 00:32:56.630
Shanxi...

00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:58.510
What? Do you have something else to do?

00:32:58.510 --> 00:32:59.480
When can I come back?

00:32:59.480 --> 00:32:59.880
Well,

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.310
everyone has their own family matters
to deal with.

00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:01.790
But...

00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:04.000
This is what we do
in the Criminal Police Team.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.070
Ready to set off at any moment.

00:33:05.070 --> 00:33:06.160
Come on, you need to get used to it.

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:06.560
Hurry.

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:07.680
I can't go.

00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:12.680
What do you mean?

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:14.880
I really can't go.

00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:16.080
Then give me a reason.

00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:19.870
Captain Song,

00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:22.070
there's been another incident
in the hutong case.

00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:23.070
I can't leave now.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.240
You foolish kid!

00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:26.960
The case you'd be working on this time

00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:28.270
is also a major case, you know?

00:33:28.270 --> 00:33:29.000
It's robbery

00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:29.960
in Zhejiang Village,

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:31.030
with four people murdered.

00:33:31.030 --> 00:33:32.240
The killer is now delivering goods
in Shanxi.

00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:33.200
We've located his hideout.

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:33.920
We need to act fast.

00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:35.270
But this case is a serial one.

00:33:35.270 --> 00:33:35.680
Now...

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:37.200
Why don't you go work in the archives?

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:39.000
It's full of unsolved cases there.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:39.800
Captain Song,

00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:41.310
I just want to go back

00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:42.440
and follow up on some leads.

00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:44.970
If you go back,
don't bother coming back here.

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:49.530
The cases are piling up.

00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:50.760
I can't avoid it.

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:55.110
There are so many other cases.

00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:56.440
What about these cases?

00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:57.590
There are several stabbing victims too.

00:33:57.590 --> 00:33:58.590
What should we do?

00:33:59.640 --> 00:33:59.960
Look,

00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:00.880
if you can't solve this case,

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:01.350
what then?

00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:03.070
Will you spend your whole life on it?

00:34:03.070 --> 00:34:03.590
There are dozens,

00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:04.790
hundreds of cases waiting for us.

00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:05.480
If everyone were like you,

00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:07.740
we might just shut down the police force.

00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:10.159
But I must solve this particular case.

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:21.190
Fine.

00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:24.590
I'll grant your wish.

00:34:24.590 --> 00:34:26.120
Go back to the local station

00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:28.850
and continue your investigation there.

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:36.800
I'm sorry, Captain Song.

00:34:40.110 --> 00:34:41.639
You're not letting me down.

00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:45.239
You're letting yourself down.

00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:46.090
You're just

00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:47.480
simply beyond help.

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:49.600
Be careful out there.

00:34:49.710 --> 00:34:50.370
Get to work.

00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:58.450
When I leave this hutong someday,

00:34:58.670 --> 00:35:00.000
I'll write you a letter.

00:35:02.110 --> 00:35:03.230
And when you see that letter,

00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:04.590
you'll remember tonight

00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:05.530
and think of me.

00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:08.230
By then I should be
in the Criminal Police Team.

00:35:34.070 --> 00:35:35.110
After the exams,

00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:37.360
I want to go out and travel.

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:40.290
Let's go.

00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:42.280
Let's go now.

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:43.700
No need to wait.

00:35:45.070 --> 00:35:46.670
It's late, no one will see us.

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:47.780
Come on.

00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:27.780
Tian Chang.

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:36.760
Where are we?

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:38.930
I don't know either.

00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:02.250
It's beautiful.

00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:18.050
Do you remember

00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:19.400
those math problems from childhood

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:22.000
about calculating
when two people would meet?

00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:28.110
Three, two, one,

00:37:28.590 --> 00:37:29.510
go!

00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:54.320
Ready, march!

00:37:57.790 --> 00:37:58.480
Wait!

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:01.150
Your steps aren't in sync.

00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:02.480
Your steps need to be together,

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:04.280
so only one sound should be heard.

00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:05.210
Let's try again.

00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:06.760
March!

00:38:18.190 --> 00:38:19.670
We've all had our hearing tested,

00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:21.270
our hearings are excellent.

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:23.130
He made no noise.

00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:31.620
He was totally silent,

00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:33.630
like a ghost.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:20.930
-89.
-87

00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:30.670
-105.
-112.

00:39:57.920 --> 00:39:58.760
150.

00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:20.800
Again.

00:40:58.960 --> 00:40:59.760
-15.
-16.

00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:29.110
-47.
-47.

00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:33.630
Let's celebrate.

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:49.840
Our first name...

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:51.970
It was named Pan Gu Creating the World.

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:53.800
There were no women in it.

00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:56.150
We finally chose the name "Adam and Eve".

00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:56.590
Right,

00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:58.550
then there are both a man and a woman.

00:41:58.550 --> 00:41:59.710
I see, so that's how it was.

00:41:59.710 --> 00:42:00.670
I'd like to ask

00:42:00.690 --> 00:42:01.880
when you opened this shop,

00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:03.480
did your family support you?

00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:05.600
They did.

00:42:09.070 --> 00:42:09.440
My-

00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:11.460
my husband is a police officer.

00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:13.550
He's very busy with his work,

00:42:15.510 --> 00:42:17.570
but he's extremely supportive of me.

00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:18.870
He even told me

00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:21.320
that we should embrace

00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:23.660
the winds of reform and opening up.

00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:26.050
Without his support,

00:42:26.110 --> 00:42:27.150
I wouldn't have been able to

00:42:27.150 --> 00:42:29.010
make my business what it is today.

00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:31.010
And my son

00:42:31.110 --> 00:42:32.880
is about to
take the College Entrance Exam.

00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:33.610
I really hope

00:42:33.610 --> 00:42:35.230
he gets good results.

00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:38.320
Good to hear that.

00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:39.400
I wish your son

00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:40.660
success in his exams.

00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:42.480
And thank you both for the interview,

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:43.230
thank you.

00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:45.300
I wish your business prosperity.

00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:48.380
Now, let's turn our attention
to another piece of news.

00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:14.400
When I was little,

00:43:15.070 --> 00:43:17.130
my dad and I used to play this game too.

00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:19.850
I was quite happy back then.

00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:24.030
Then why do you want to leave now?

00:43:28.070 --> 00:43:30.510
Why were you crying that day?

00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:34.150
Because

00:43:35.070 --> 00:43:36.070
I kept blinking.

00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:37.400
What?

00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:40.880
You can't blink during a fight.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:41.880
Why can't you blink

00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:42.960
during a fight?

00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:44.970
Your reactions get slower.

00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:48.280
Have you learned how to do it now?

00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:48.940
Yes, I have.

00:43:49.150 --> 00:43:49.750
Look at me.

00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:57.290
I didn't blink, right?

00:43:58.670 --> 00:43:59.770
You just blinked!

00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:01.250
That was a sneak attack!

00:44:01.710 --> 00:44:03.240
Sneak attacks don't count!

00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:14.930
I didn't blink, right?

00:44:15.670 --> 00:44:16.530
Doesn't count.

00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:17.890
Let's try again.

00:44:21.070 --> 00:44:22.870
Doesn't count. Let's try again.

00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:24.760
Again.

00:44:27.110 --> 00:44:27.970
Doesn't count.

00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:37.510
You really didn't blink.
