and they've grown so large.

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:47.280

How much time does he have left?

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.759
When he gets home, let him eat, drink,

Where have you been?

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.640
I had some family issues.

That's just how it is when you get old.

What's there to interpret?

I broke something,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.860
It was my fault,

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:55.150
so I should pay for it.

Objects don't have feelings.

why you smashed things.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:06.600
Isn't that why I came here

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.310
Could it be
that you're under too much stress?

What kind of stress could I possibly have?

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:15.560
The more you avoid stress,
the worse it gets.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:16.480
Did I avoid it?

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:18.740

what you did right before your outburst.

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:33.159
It's really nothing.

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:34.870
At a place like the police station,

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:35.240
well,

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.950
you have to respect your seniors, right?

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:38.360
When I first started working,

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.480
wasn't I always

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:40.880
respectful to my mentor?

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:42.720
But these young people nowadays

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:43.560
have no sense of respect.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:44.630
They were bossing me around,

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:45.560
and nagging at me.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.360
I just couldn't take it anymore.

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:50.390
You wanted to teach him a lesson.

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.950
Yeah.

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:53.630
Has he treated you like that before?

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:55.120
I don't know.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:56.750
Why were you

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:57.810
so angry this time?

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:01.600
In your previous

interactions with your mentor,

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:06.160
you've always been
respectful to your mentor,

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:06.960
is that right?

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.160
Of course.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.100
How is he doing?

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:13.510
He's sick.

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:17.390
He's dying.

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:19.620
What's wrong with him?

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:31.020
How do you feel about that?

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:33.680
What am I supposed to feel?

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:34.540
I feel nothing.

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:36.790
Don't ask me about feelings.

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:39.230
You're very sad, aren't you?

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:42.310
My mentor and I

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:43.909
haven't spoken for 18 years.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Why would I be sad?

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:56.190
Our conversation itself

00:07:58.310 --> 00:07:59.480
is a form of therapy.

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:00.630
Zhao, if you...

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:01.750
Don't call me Zhao.

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:04.270
It sounds weird to me.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:07.750
It makes me feel like
we're from different generations.

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:09.350
Just say what you need to say.

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.679
I remember you didn't smoke before.

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:42.169
That's written in my file too?

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.080
You therapists

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.130
think you're better than cops.

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:47.860
Why don't you solve cases then?

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:54.200
Do you remember you once said...

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:57.120
that mental illness is just something

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.450
psychiatrists made up?

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:01.510
So you should understand

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:03.040
that I'm not sick right now.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.200
There's a term called "heart knot."

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:07.570
Have you heard of it?

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:10.030
I only know dead knots

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:11.270
and tangles.

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:13.440
Yes, exactly like tangles.

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:16.890
People have emotions.

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:18.440
After experiencing

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:19.840
significant psychological trauma,

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.150
if one's emotions
aren't properly addressed...

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:22.120
Enough, enough.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.960
This is exactly what I need right now.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.000
I feel fantastic right now.

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.320
But your anger

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.480
hurts the innocent people

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.120
around you.

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.440
Am I angry?

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:34.800
I'm not angry, and I have no temper.

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:36.600
Then why did you smash things?

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:37.460
I lost control.

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:42.240
Fine.

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.250
Next time before you lose control,

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:48.960
remember to

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.730
count down from 20 in your mind.

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:52.080
Forget it.

Your ex-fiancé?

He said he wants to return my things.

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:17.740
And there's something

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:20.360

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:22.750

So I'd look good that way.

00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:50.030
Am I shallow?

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:53.230
That's understandable.

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:55.400
But I have an assignment here...

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:56.730
I really can't get away.

00:19:57.310 --> 00:19:59.000
What about tomorrow or the day after?

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.880
Consider my schedule, I think...

00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:02.550
let's just forget it.

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:05.200
Fine.

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:08.400
It's okay.

Next time I won't help you either.

00:20:55.790 --> 00:20:57.390
In our Criminal Police Team,

00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:59.680
there was this really handsome guy,

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:02.000
but he's not smart.

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:04.310
If he talked
for more than three sentences,

00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:05.310
he'd go off topic.

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:06.920
So I taught him a trick.

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:09.820
After that, the girls chasing him

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:10.810
lined up in rows.

00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:13.030
Are you implying

00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:14.110
that I'm not smart?

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:17.110
Do you want to hear this or not?

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:17.550
Yes.

00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:27.320
I actually
don't quite understand it myself.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:29.960
How did you

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:31.490
and your wife get together?

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:36.980
Back in the day, I had just joined
the Criminal Police Team.

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:38.640
I was young and naive.

00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:41.550
Someone sneaked into their factory

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:43.550
to peep at the women's bathhouse.

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:44.720
I actually

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:46.050
caught the guy already.

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:47.880
But guess what?

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:51.030
I let that brat go again.

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:52.240
Why?

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:57.930
I let him run across the factory

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:00.480
so I could chase him down.

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:02.830
We ran two big laps

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:04.920
in the factory.

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:06.160
Finally,

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:08.410
in front of all the female workers,

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:10.880
I kicked him down to the ground,

00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:12.110
and arrested him.

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:14.440
After that,

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:19.210
I started getting little notes

00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:21.830
and messages

00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:23.130
from the girls.

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:27.030
So your wife

00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:27.960
passed you a note too?

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:28.820
No, not really.

00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:30.960
In the end, I talked to

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:32.880
their head of security about it.

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:35.000
So your wife is quite impressive, huh?

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:35.440
Yes.

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:38.310
If she were a criminal,

00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:41.150
I probably couldn't handle her.

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:45.830
Later,

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:48.310
their factory

00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:49.640
wasn't doing very well.

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:52.400
Her family

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:54.110
gave her some money

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:56.110
to find another job.

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:00.350
That was right when my mentor

00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:01.410
had that accident.

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:02.830
So I took that money

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:06.120
and paid for my mentor's medical bills.

00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:09.160
She then went south to start a business,

00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:11.480
and went through a lot of hardship.

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:13.640
She always wanted

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:14.790
a motorcycle.

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:20.000
But I never bought her one.

00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:38.960
Isn't that...

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:40.330
who I think it is?

00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:50.790
That guy's footsteps

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:53.310
are a bit too neat.

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:54.750

00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:28.860
to the darkest place,

00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:30.760
I pulled out the bottle.

00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:33.440
I guess at that moment,

00:45:34.070 --> 00:45:35.320
they were thirsty.

00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:38.320
Their eyes were fixed on that bottle.

00:45:39.230 --> 00:45:43.320
Maybe they're just craving a drink.

00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:54.670
At the intersection of Changchun Street

00:45:54.670 --> 00:45:55.760
and Jingyang Street, right?

00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:56.150
Okay.

00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:10.670
Why aren't you lecturing me today?

00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:15.360
Why are you so quiet?

00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:17.960
I'm just

00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:20.330
listening to you, aren't I?

00:46:22.670 --> 00:46:23.800
Something's wrong.

00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:27.110
You're acting weird today.

00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:30.550
Usually you talk a lot about...

00:46:31.230 --> 00:46:32.670
psychology,

00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:35.960
consciousness, personality and stuff.

00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:37.710
But today,

00:46:37.710 --> 00:46:39.640
you don't have a single question.a

00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:41.240
[Ask: What do you think
the police will think of you?]

00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:43.920
I... I certainly have questions.

00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:44.580
[Ask: What do you think
the police will think of you?]

00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:47.660
I just haven't had the chance to ask yet.

00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:49.840
[Ask: What do you think
the police will think of you?]

00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:51.150
I wanted to ask you,

00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:52.760
what do you think

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:54.190
the police

00:46:55.150 --> 00:46:56.440
will think of you?

00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:00.840
The police definitely think

00:47:01.710 --> 00:47:04.150
the hutong killer is a badass.

00:47:05.590 --> 00:47:07.520
They can't catch me no matter what.

00:47:07.550 --> 00:47:08.710
Who's better now?

00:47:09.510 --> 00:47:11.110
I'm driving them crazy.

00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:19.580
[Sexual impotence makes you pathetic]

00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:21.070
[Sexual impotence makes you pathetic]

00:47:21.070 --> 00:47:22.230
My friend,

00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:24.280
perhaps,

00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:25.550
perhaps...

00:47:26.510 --> 00:47:28.150
the police think you're impotent.

00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:29.400
You're sexually frustrated,

00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:31.150
and that's why you went to stab women.

00:47:31.150 --> 00:47:31.880
Actually,

00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:33.800
you're really pathetic.

00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:42.110
You're not alone today, are you?

00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:46.230
Of course I'm alone.

00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:57.730
Right now, the one sitting next to you

00:47:58.630 --> 00:48:01.400
is the younger one

00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:04.070
or the older one?

00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:09.760
Say hi for me.

00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:44.670
Listen,

00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:47.400
why...

00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:52.320
did you do that?

00:48:55.070 --> 00:48:57.000
I can't suppress my urges anymore.

00:48:57.800 --> 00:48:58.760
Catch me

00:49:00.110 --> 00:49:02.590
and we'll talk face to face.
