[DEAD END]

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.350
[Episode 13]

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.280
[1994]

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.350
Didn't you already note down
the license plate number?

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.410
Why are you still going to see You Jia?

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.680
Have you ever heard

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:57.479
a Hugo's poem...

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.560
Come in.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.750
Mr. Wang.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.960
Mr. Wang.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.050
We just want to ask a few questions.

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:21.190
What is it?

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:22.870
How many times

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.610
has Zhang Dan been here?

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:26.030
Who?

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.030
Zhang Dan.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.430
I have many students here.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.250
I'm not quite sure about that.

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.490
You have quite a lot of girls here.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:45.470
We also have boys.

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.040
[Name: Huang Xinyan,
Huang Jialin, Huang Qing.]

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.970
There are fewer boys in your class.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.400
Young girls

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.930
are easy to deceive,

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:53.810
aren't they?

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.120
Well, girls

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.840
have stronger language learning abilities

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.190
than boys from an early age.

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.560
So, it's normal to have more girls
in my class.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.590
I noticed other classes

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.120
have a normal gender ratio,

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:06.470
but in your class,

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.890
girls are the majority.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.330
Mr. Wang has great personal charm.

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:11.490
You flatter me.

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.970
Has Liu Ke taken classes here?

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.430
Who is Liu Ke, then?

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.310
Excuse me.

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.910
I need to...

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:31.030
Go ahead.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.640
Please go with your work.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:40.470
Thank you.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.980
Your register.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.880
I don't know if Zhang Dan has been here.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.120
Strangely, there are fewer people
with the surname Liu on the register.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.000
Do you know

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.750
what the strangest thing is?

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.280
From beginning to end, he never asked

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.880
why we were questioning him.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.960
We must pay attention to

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:03.820
tenses—

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.590
The shift of verbs

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:06.590
from present continuous

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:07.960
to past tense.

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.960
Silent, please.

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.820
Okay, let's continue.

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:19.560
For example,

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:20.860
simple past tense—

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.430
I watched a movie yesterday.

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:37.390
That's enough.

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:37.430
Where did you find this girl?

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:38.740
You saved her life.

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:39.900
What happened?

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:42.430
This child

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:43.920
didn't even know

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.360
she was bleeding internally.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.240
We've been working on her

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.310
from last night until this morning.

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:48.000
And,

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:48.830
I guess

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:51.330
she won't be able
to give birth in the future.

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:52.880
How did this happen?

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.070
She won't tell us anything,

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:56.310
not a single word.

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:56.950
Until now,

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:58.360
we don't even know her name,

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.420
let alone what caused her condition.

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:05.580
Young lady,

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:06.970
don't be afraid.

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:08.520
We're police officers.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.920
Tell me who hurt you.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.890
We'll help you get justice.

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:17.560
Do you know Wang Kun?

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:32.510
What are you doing?

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:34.240
We're having a class right now.

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:35.600
We're having a class right now.

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:36.360
Policing.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.120
Where's Wang Kun?

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:42.720
He's on leave.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:43.950
On leave?

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:45.000
Yes.

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:46.560
Do you know where he went?

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:47.310
I don't know.

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:01.120
You Jia.

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:05.490
I need to talk to you.

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:28.510
What is it?

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:31.630
That guy's name,

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:32.840
the one who was with you last time,

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:33.900
is Wang Kun, right?

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:35.320
Yes.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.730
Have you seen him recently?

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.400
Are you still in contact?

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:44.169
What's going on?

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:47.430
You'd better stay away from him.

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:48.840
He's dangerous.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.150
Do police officers

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:51.510
see everyone as a suspect?

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:52.600
I'm not joking with you.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.860
He's really a suspect.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.730
That's impossible.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.170
He's my teacher.

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:20.240
Can I go in and see her?

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:46.440
Hello.

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:48.320
I'm You Jia.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.120
Do you remember the thing

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.320
that happened to you?

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.090
You smashed his car.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.390
Because you wanted revenge on him,

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:03.050
didn't you?

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:19.010
Don't be afraid.

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:21.080
I'm also Wang Kun's student.

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:24.870
I take his class, too.

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:26.480
So if there's anything—

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:30.240
Run.

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:33.390
Run...

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.260
Don't move!

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:37.080
Take care.

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:37.670
It's okay.

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:38.470
It's okay now.

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:39.720
Miss,

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:41.560
are you alright?

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:44.770
You're safe now.

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:48.440
Don't be afraid.

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:49.480
You're safe.

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:51.120
It's okay now.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:52.650
You'll never be hurt again.

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:53.840
Never again.

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:07.320
You'll never be hurt again.

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:12.630
Tell me that

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:14.780
when you're ready to talk.

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:24.080
Mr. Wang.

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:29.290
These are the test papers
we just finished.

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:30.600
Where should I put them?

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:31.790
In this cabinet.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:35.550
Mr. Wang.

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:36.880
I'll put them here then.

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:44.680
Li Jing.

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:47.080
You know...

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:49.080
You are the most talented

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.270
and gifted student

00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:51.320
I've ever met.

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:54.790
Really?

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:57.410
Thank you.

00:11:58.030 --> 00:11:58.440
I...

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:01.240
I'll definitely study hard
with you in the future.

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:02.930
Do you have a boyfriend?

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:07.200
No.

00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:12.030
You're very smart.

00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:14.270
At your age,

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:15.550
you should focus

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:16.480
on your studies.

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:20.550
Don't let yourself get distracted.

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:33.960
Sir.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.390
Linda, she...

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:38.750
Linda suddenly

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:39.840
has to attend a party

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:40.840
and won't be here.

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:52.270
It's yummy.

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:12.270
Is the locksmith here?

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:12.840
Yes.

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:13.370
Let's go.

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:27.320
Mentor!

00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:57.390
The one who can't let go of you is me.

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:04.630
The one who can't live without you is me.

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:07.440
The tape Liu Ke was listening to

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:08.570
was sung by Wang Kun.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.600
She was also Wang Kun's student.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:11.930
We also have witnesses.

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:13.000
It must be him.

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:15.360
We've contacted immigration.

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:16.270
There's no record of anyone named Wang Kun

00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:18.000
leaving the country recently.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:18.870
Is it possible that

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:20.600
the girl smashed his car,

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.320
and he left town for a few days

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:23.360
to avoid the trouble?

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:24.600
That would only mean

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:26.230
he has more than one hideout.

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:28.390
Have you contacted the school principal?

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:28.910
Yes, we have.

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:30.440
But he can't reach Wang Kun.

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:35.540
[Quiet]

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:37.630
Li Jing.

00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:42.390
Where is she?

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:45.420
She harmed herself

00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:47.630
and was taken to the emergency room.

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:32.000
Page 1334821.

00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:37.600
Let's meet up.

00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:40.840
Mr. Wang.

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:50.050
What did you say to Wang Kun?

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:51.250
I asked him to meet me.

00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:52.600
Are you crazy?

00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:54.360
Do you know how dangerous that is?

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:55.690
Li Jing harmed herself.

She's been taken to the emergency room.

00:15:57.340 --> 00:15:58.210
I know.

00:15:58.390 --> 00:15:59.990
But that's not your concern.

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:01.450
We, the police, will catch him.

00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:02.360
But right now I'm the only one

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:03.030
who can contact him,

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:03.600
right?

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:04.680
And don't worry.

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:05.720
I'm a nurse.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:07.770
I've prepared everything.

00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:08.670
You think with these things

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:09.730
you can handle him?

00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:10.910
He's a suspect.

He's a criminal.

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:13.600
But I...

I have to do something, don't I?

00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:19.960
Has he responded to you?

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:20.870
No.

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:23.240
I paged him.

00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:25.480
But there's no message from him now.

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:26.910
He knows where you live.

I bring you some fruit.

Shine the laser on my nail.

Are you wearing the fluorescent polish?

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:31.070
My mom doesn't let me wear nail polish,

00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:32.110
so I use this instead.

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:33.110
Does it look nice?

Yes.

This is the birthday present

There's still half left.

Today is your birthday?

I'm turning 19 today.

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:49.280
Happy birthday.

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:50.240
Thank you.

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:54.280
I should have bought you a gift.

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:56.720
I haven't received a gift in ages.

00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:58.830
Why don't you perform something for me?

00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:00.090
That can be my present.

I don't know how.

That's all.

It's from Don Quixote.

You're brave, too.

Why did you run away?

I'll tell you later.

There was just a strong wind.

Everything got blown to the floor.

I just have one thing to say.

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:33.920
Don't give the child a hard time anymore.

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:34.880
We didn't.

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:36.110
Thank you.

00:28:37.270 --> 00:28:38.550
Thank you so much.

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:39.900
Let me get some dishes.
Let's have a drink.

00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:40.460
Alright.

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:42.340
Thanks.

00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:47.800
[Recycling]

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:52.400
[Missing Person]

00:28:58.240 --> 00:28:59.310
Just settle for this.

00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:01.370
I only know how to make simple dishes.

00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:02.400
My apologies,

00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:03.880
having my bodyguard cook for me.

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:05.680
I've been your bodyguard for two days now.

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:07.160
I need to go back
to being a police officer.

00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:09.160
I have to work the night shift later.

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:11.100
I'll come back after my shift.

00:29:11.290 --> 00:29:12.550
If Wang Kun contacts you,

00:29:12.550 --> 00:29:13.750
tell me immediately.

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:14.560
Of course.

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:19.350
I just wanted to help,

00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:21.610
but it ended up causing trouble instead.

00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:22.960
Well...

00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:24.570
I was good to Xiaolong.

00:29:25.270 --> 00:29:26.130
Xiaolong died.

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:29.040
I went to take care of Li Jing.

00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:32.280
Something happened to her as well.

00:29:34.270 --> 00:29:35.310
It's so strange.

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:37.830
None of this has anything to do with you.

00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:38.960
Don't overthink it.

00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:45.960
Well,

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:48.610
why can people be so evil?

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:51.520
My mentor said

00:29:52.550 --> 00:29:54.210
never ask why about anything.

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:03.810
I guess I should go back.

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:07.000
It's not mine.

00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:16.480
He replied to me.

00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:17.890
He replied to me.

00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:20.250
[I'm leaving. See you, Wang Kun.]

00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:23.550
He's left?

00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:49.640
Where had you been?

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:50.940
Just tell us, will you?

00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:14.870
I really... I just can't understand.

00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:16.770
What

00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:17.640
did we do wrong

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:19.120
to deserve this from you?

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:21.030
Since you were little,

00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:23.960
we provided for all your needs.

00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:26.350
We rented an apartment

00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:28.550
so you could go to school in the city.

00:31:28.790 --> 00:31:30.040
All we want is

00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:32.000
for you to be safe and sound.

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:34.590
But you just left.

00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:37.350
Did you ever think about us?

00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:41.030
What are we supposed to do if you leave?

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:43.110
This family will fall apart.

00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:44.310
Do you know that?

00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:51.680
If you're unhappy with us about something,

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:52.640
just say it.

00:31:53.030 --> 00:31:54.200
What exactly

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:55.270
did we do wrong?

00:31:55.270 --> 00:31:56.400
Just tell us.

00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:58.970
And we can change. Isn't that acceptable?

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:01.330
Whether steamed buns taste good or not

00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:04.350
depends entirely on the recipe.

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:07.310
If the recipe is wrong,

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:09.640
all your effort is wasted.

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:11.910
The stage you are at now

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:13.800
is just like kneading dough.

00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:15.640
You need to follow the proper steps—

00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:17.440
how much yeast to add,

00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:18.990
how many pieces of sugar—

00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:19.720
it's not about

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:22.000
doing whatever you want.

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:23.440
There are rules.

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:24.960
Of course.

00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:27.750
Not everything traditional is right.

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:29.160
In the old days, when making dough,

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:30.680
we would add baking soda.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.270
It made the buns turn yellow when steamed.

00:32:33.270 --> 00:32:34.790
Something this serious has happened,

00:32:34.790 --> 00:32:35.790
and you're still here

00:32:35.790 --> 00:32:37.510
teaching her how to make buns?

00:32:37.550 --> 00:32:40.160
Every time I try to teach our child,
you interrupt.

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:42.960
Every time I try to teach our child,
you interrupt.

00:32:44.110 --> 00:32:47.240
In education,
correctness isn't determined

00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:49.700
by who speaks the loudest.

00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:50.910
Well,

00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:54.240
flour comes in high-gluten,
medium-gluten, and low-gluten.

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:56.890
Which one is best for steamed buns?

00:32:57.270 --> 00:32:58.200
Medium-gluten.

00:32:58.790 --> 00:33:00.250
It must be medium-gluten.

00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:02.240
Why?

00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:04.550
Because generations of master chefs

00:33:04.550 --> 00:33:06.350
have figured it out through experience.

00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:07.350
It can't be wrong.

00:33:07.790 --> 00:33:08.550
Well,

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:10.800
you need to have a materialistic

00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:11.760
view of history.

00:33:11.790 --> 00:33:12.520
Understand?

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:14.270
Is this how you teach her?

00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:16.170
Stop pretending

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:18.870
to be some intellectual.

00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:21.030
Tell her something practical.

00:33:21.030 --> 00:33:22.160
How much more practical can I be?

00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:22.830
What I'm saying

00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:24.480
is as practical as it gets.

00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:26.560
What I'm saying

00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:27.880
is profound in meaning

00:33:28.030 --> 00:33:29.490
yet simple in expression.

00:33:29.790 --> 00:33:31.250
Why can't you understand?

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:33.720
You don't read books or newspapers.

00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:35.720
That's why you've raised

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:36.830
her to be like this.

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:38.960
You're the one who made her this way.

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:40.160
If this child had been raised
according to my methods

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:41.480
since childhood,

00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:42.240
she wouldn't be like this.

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:42.970
And now she's

00:33:43.030 --> 00:33:43.790
ruined.

00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:46.400
This child is ruined.

00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:49.350
Is this all my fault?

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:50.720
-Aren't you responsible?
-Yes.

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:51.160
Yes.

00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:51.920
Yes.

00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:54.400
I...

00:33:54.510 --> 00:33:54.960
Yes.

00:33:55.030 --> 00:33:56.520
-I've done so much—
-Yeah.

00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:57.640
Absolutely right. It's all your fault.

00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:59.480
Exactly right. It's all your fault.

00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:01.160
I've done so much for this family.

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:03.880
-But you blame me?
-It's all your fault. It's all your fault.

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:04.640
So, shut up.

00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:05.880
I work from dawn till dusk

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:07.610
-to serve you two.
-So, shut up.

00:34:08.150 --> 00:34:08.960
So, shut up.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:09.630
Shut up!

00:34:13.150 --> 00:34:14.280
When steaming buns,

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:15.510
after you wrap them,

00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:17.070
you let them proof on the steamer rack.

00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:18.590
If they are proofed for too long,

00:34:18.590 --> 00:34:20.030
the bottom will fall out
and the soup will leak.

00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:21.960
This is the same principle as life—

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:38.550
I want to sleep alone.

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:41.690
The small storage room is fine.

00:34:43.630 --> 00:34:45.090
I also want to wear a skirt.

00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:48.000
The red one.

00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:22.230
Son.

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:25.320
Dad was once

00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:26.670
your age, too.

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:30.400
I understand

00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:32.610
all your little issues.

00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:36.590
Dad.

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:39.030
I swear we didn't do anything.

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:42.160
I just wanted to help her.

00:35:45.590 --> 00:35:47.120
So, what do you want me to do?

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:49.610
Pretend I didn't see anything?

00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:51.210
Left you two alone?

00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:52.590
Why not?

00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:53.840
Of course not.

00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:56.200
I'm a police officer.

00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:57.590
Tian Chang's parents

00:35:57.590 --> 00:35:58.920
have already filed a report.

00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:00.070
Her parents have come to the station

00:36:00.070 --> 00:36:01.510
and made a fuss many times.

00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:03.000
If I help you cover this up,

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:04.360
I would have to...

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:08.610
I'd have to resign as a police officer.

00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:11.480
But your doing will hurt her.

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:12.820
Who's hurting her?

00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:14.320
Her parents?

00:36:16.110 --> 00:36:18.170
Aren't they her biological parents?

00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:19.400
Why would they want to hurt

00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:20.670
their own daughter?

00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:25.320
Her parents beat her, control her,

00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:25.920
oppress her,

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:26.960
and don't let her go out.

00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:28.000
About the beating,

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.460
I've already warned them.

00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:30.760
If they dare to lay a hand on her again,

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:32.560
I'll be the first to arrest them.

00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:34.990
But about what you mentioned...

00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:37.230
control,

00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:39.480
what can I do about that?

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:43.590
But we're free, aren't we?

00:36:43.590 --> 00:36:43.960
Yes.

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:45.190
You can be free.

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:47.800
But shouldn't you finish
the college entrance exam first?

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:48.280
Tell me,

00:36:49.110 --> 00:36:49.960
if your child

00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:51.070
runs away from home every day,

00:36:51.070 --> 00:36:52.230
wouldn't you need to

00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:54.160
lock her up and keep an eye on her?

00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:55.440
Well, think about it.

00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:56.410
Why would a girl

00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:57.320
stay outside

00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:58.880
for so long without going home,

00:36:58.880 --> 00:36:59.840
preferring to sleep on the streets?

00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:00.510
Why is that?

00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:02.320
Maybe it's because she's

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:03.450
being disobedient.

00:37:04.030 --> 00:37:04.550
Have you

00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:05.840
done nothing wrong at all?

00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:06.970
What did we do wrong?

00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:27.070
Son.

00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:29.130
I'm only going to ask once.

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:30.710
Tell me the truth.

00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:34.440
Did you two

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:41.290
have sexual relations?

00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:50.110
Dad.

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:53.840
Why...

00:37:55.630 --> 00:37:57.030
Why would you think that?

00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:10.320
No matter what your answer is,

00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:12.630
I won't tell your mother

00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:14.190
or anyone else.

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:17.480
I just want to help you.

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:21.510
But

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:25.230
I hope my son

00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:27.190
can tell me the truth.

00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:28.150
I didn't.

00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:46.840
I

00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:48.700
have been a policeman all my life.

00:38:49.070 --> 00:38:50.670
I've met all kinds of people.

00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:59.080
You've already drawn your conclusion.

00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:00.960
You won't believe my explanation anyway.

00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:02.560
Then give me an explanation!

00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:12.050
Would it even help if I explained?

00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:53.400
Coming.

00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:06.870
Why are you so late?

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.460
I've been waiting for you—

00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:12.570
Hello, You Jia.

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:16.760
Mr. Wang?

00:40:19.110 --> 00:40:20.510
Weren't you out of town?

00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:23.680
My schedule changed at the last minute,

00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:24.800
so I didn't go.

00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:28.360
May I come in?

00:40:30.070 --> 00:40:30.880
Yes, of course.

00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:31.550
Okay.

00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:40.500
This little courtyard is quite nice.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.710
Do you live here alone?

00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:45.510
Yes.

00:40:50.070 --> 00:40:50.930
It's very nice.

00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:52.890
It's very nice.

00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:54.000
Recently,

00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:56.400
there's been demolition in this area,

00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:58.460
so these two families here moved out.

00:41:02.590 --> 00:41:04.030
Is this your room?

00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:07.400
I find that girls' rooms

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:08.550
are always so cozy.

00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:10.920
Mr. Wang.

00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:13.230
Let me get you some water.

00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:14.760
Please sit down.

00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:15.420
Have a seat.

00:41:16.210 --> 00:41:17.070
Okay, thank you.

00:41:17.070 --> 00:41:17.670
I'll be right there.

00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:18.110
OK.

00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:42.900
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:44.630
Thank you.

00:41:56.920 --> 00:41:57.630
How come

00:41:57.630 --> 00:41:59.690
you haven't been teaching recently?

00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:01.000
I've had some unexpected

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.150
issues at home.

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:04.600
I've been dealing with family matters.

00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:05.710
Do you

00:42:06.110 --> 00:42:07.440
need something from me?

00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:10.360
You've disappeared recently.

00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:12.620
Everyone's been very worried about you.

00:42:14.110 --> 00:42:15.840
You were worried about me, too?

00:42:17.150 --> 00:42:17.750
Of course.

00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:19.440
Of course.

00:42:22.590 --> 00:42:23.230
You Jia.

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:25.360
Do you know,

00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:27.640
of all the students I've taught,

00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:29.480
you are the most

00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:30.710
talented and gifted

00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:32.360
student I've ever seen?

00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:33.550
Trust me.

00:42:33.550 --> 00:42:35.210
I'm never wrong about people.

00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:48.590
Mr. Wang.

00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:52.320
Do you remember Li Jing?

00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:54.360
Who?

00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:57.070
She is also your student.

00:42:57.800 --> 00:42:58.480
Li Jing.

00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:02.110
I don't remember her.

00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:03.840
I... I have too many students.

00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:05.300
I can't remember them all.

00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:08.970
Something happened to her.

00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:11.040
She met a psychopath.

00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:12.650
And she harmed herself.

00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:16.360
Who told you that?

00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:19.620
Everyone's talking about it.

00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:23.970
You should be careful, too.

00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:28.800
If it were me...

00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:31.150
If I ever met him,

00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:35.020
I would never let him get away with it.

00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:37.400
If you

00:43:38.590 --> 00:43:40.390
actually met someone like that,

00:43:41.550 --> 00:43:42.550
what would you do?

00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:47.880
I would kill him.

00:43:55.110 --> 00:43:56.760
I like your attitude.

00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:00.710
You Jia.

00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:04.510
You told me before that you work

00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:08.240
at Anding Hospital, right?

00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:14.360
Why did you

00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:15.510
do that to Li Jing?

00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:39.920
You little brat. I'll strangle you.

00:44:42.590 --> 00:44:43.670
Help!
