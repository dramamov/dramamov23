00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.070
Xu Wanning.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.030
Who are you?

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.990
- Let go of me.
- Move.

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:53.000
Let go of me.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.870
Move.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.150
Does it still hurt?

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.120
It doesn't hurt when you're here.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.560
Thank you, Commander Pei.

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.040
Chang'an came back in a good mood.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.040
No one gave him a hard time anymore.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.000
We are family.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.000
This is what I should do.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.430
All right. Rest and recover.

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.480
I should go.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.280
I can't open this door.

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:03.590
Chang'an, Ruyi.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.430
What are you doing at the door?

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.070
Open it, quickly.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.190
The key is missing, Mother.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:10.870
Just sleep here for the night.

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:12.430
You are husband and wife anyway.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.800
Hey, you two.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.240
Where are you going? Come back.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.280
Wait till I get out.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.400
Come back, Chang'an.

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:32.590
With your skills,

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.240
opening this should be easy, right?

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.840
Normally, yes.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.680
I could break it easily.

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.470
But now, I…

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:55.430
We can get out here.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.840
Careful.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.560
Commander, are you all right?

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.020
Get up.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:16.960
How is it? You okay?

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.560
I'm fine. Are you?

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:19.680
I'm fine.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.750
- Actually, maybe not.
- What's wrong?

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.630
Your wound must not catch the wind.

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:32.630
I'll close the window.

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.870
Huh?

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:39.310
All right, how is it?

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:42.710
Seems fine now.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.430
Good, as long as it's fine.

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:50.280
Maybe

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.190
we shouldn't fuss anymore.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.360
Let's just

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:57.680
make do for tonight.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.120
(Just one night won't matter.)

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.080
(Anyway, he's...)

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:08.750
Who are you? Let me go.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.400
Where are you taking me?

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.360
Where are you taking me?

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.520
Princess?

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.040
You saved me?

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:21.830
Thank you, Princess.

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.120
I didn't go through all that trouble
to save you

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.190
just for a few kowtows.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.830
What do you want me to do?

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.270
I'll do anything.

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.190
I will.

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:41.680
No need to go that far.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.120
Remember your ex-wife,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.480
Xu Wanning?

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:51.630
That wretch.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.190
I could tear her to pieces.

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:57.270
Very good.

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:59.870
Remember this hatred.

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.360
I'll give you a chance for revenge.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:09.640
(Xu Wanning,)

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.560
(you humiliated me and Father,)

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.430
(and stole Heng's heart.)

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.720
(You're so scheming and devious.)

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.750
(I will make sure you fail.)

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:01.960
What are you doing?

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:10.790
A mosquito.

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:17.270
Yes. A mosquito.

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.630
At this time of year?

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:39.430
Oh, here it is.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.000
My friend,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.120
I believe this is our first meeting.

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:02.430
I have some spice business to do with you.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.390
That's why I asked you here.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:07.880
Master Xu,

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:13.310
try this incense.

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:23.040
Wonderful.

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:32.080
Ruyi,

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.560
do you think Mother accepts Master now?

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:36.560
Maybe one night isn't enough.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.680
We need to give them more time together.

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:42.310
True.

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:44.360
We'll need another plan.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.000
You two scheming again?

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.390
Mother, you're up.

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:53.270
Wasn't the door locked?

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:55.680
Yes, Aunt Ning, I locked it tight.

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:57.560
You think those little tricks

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.160
can stop me?

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:04.160
Master, I need to learn from you properly.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.560
Once I've learned, I'll lock it better.

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:08.870
- You...
- Ruyi means we were wrong.

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:13.240
How should I punish you?

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:20.430
It's my failing as their master.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.720
Let me handle it.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:25.360
You two, come over here.

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.750
What were you thinking?

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.840
You shouldn't do this again.

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:36.750
Go chop firewood as your punishment.

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:38.160
Yes.

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:46.030
That's it?

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:47.670
They're just kids.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.270
A small lesson is enough.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.960
Didn't sleep well?

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:54.720
Did I wake you?

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.790
No, I slept perfectly.

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:01.080
Better than ever, actually.

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:08.120
I'll go chop some firewood too.

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:33.030
Commander.

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:37.390
Your wound can't get wet.

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:40.320
I brought the finest healing ointment.

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:41.550
Let me help you with it.

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:45.750
Just sit still.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.200
I'd better do it myself.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.270
It's fine. Just sit. I'll do it.

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:35.390
Wanning.

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:39.670
Though we have a gentleman's agreement,

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:44.120
you can't keep testing me like this.

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:47.510
I'm not testing you.

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.870
Right, the ointment stings a bit.

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:52.360
I'll be gentler.

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:53.200
No.

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.200
I mean...

00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.080
I...

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:01.440
I'm a man after all.

00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:07.870
But I heard you are...

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.040
Isn't it?

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:18.080
So you think so too?

00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:20.910
That's what everyone says.

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:23.870
Xu Wanning, you know pharmacology.

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.320
Don't you have your own judgment?

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:33.200
I do know a bit,

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:34.910
but I can't judge

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:36.840
that kind of thing.

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:42.510
Well,

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:45.150
men seem to care about that a lot.

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:46.720
But I think

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.150
integrity matters more than anything.

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:50.480
To me, those other things

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:51.360
don't matter.

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:54.080
So don't belittle yourself.

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.240
It's all right.

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:58.840
Seems you've misunderstood me deeply.

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:00.680
Why not

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:04.440
find out for yourself today?

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.440
No way.

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:17.480
But they say...

00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:19.240
You believe whatever they say?

00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:22.840
Commander.

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.510
Commander, Madam.

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:37.000
Someone from the Xu family sent word,

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.440
asking you both to come.

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:55.150
What happened, Auntie? What's going on?

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:56.840
Wanning, you're finally home.

00:12:56.950 --> 00:12:57.790
You know what?

00:12:57.790 --> 00:12:59.960
They have blocked the door all morning,

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:01.910
saying they're taking our shop.

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:03.440
What?

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:04.440
Where's Father?

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:06.150
Ever since Master came back,

00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:07.910
he's been nowhere to be seen all day long.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.150
Where is Xu Weishan?

00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:12.550
Don't think that hiding
will get you out of this.

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:15.550
He promised
to give me this shop as collateral.

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:18.630
If I can't get the deed today,

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:19.790
I'm not leaving.

00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:23.240
Mister Wang, what are you talking about?

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:25.600
My father would never promise that.

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:27.120
That I do not know.

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:28.480
He said it's urgent

00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:30.720
and took fifty thousand taels from me.

00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:35.360
Hand over the deed

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.480
or give my money back now.

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:39.150
Don't waste my time.

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:45.550
Do you know who you're talking to?

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.790
How dare you?

00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:49.670
Pei...

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:50.510
Commander Pei.

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:52.840
Please judge clearly.

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:56.480
This is written by Xu Weishan himself.

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:08.000
It's indeed my father's handwriting.

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:10.240
Right now my father is missing.

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:11.440
When we find him,

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:13.030
we will definitely sort this out.

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:15.600
I'm aware of this matter.

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:17.790
Get up and go back for now.

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:19.590
Yes, sir.

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:26.200
How did Master owe so much money?

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:27.790
What should we do?

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:30.320
Auntie, we must

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:32.030
find Father first.

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:34.320
Commander,

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:37.150
someone said they saw Master Xu
at the pleasure quarter.

00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:38.390
What?

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.260
Could he be taking a concubine

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:42.910
and spending everything?

00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:44.030
Auntie, calm down.

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:48.200
Look,

00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:50.320
we'll go and see for ourselves.

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:53.510
Let's go.

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:57.910
Where's my incense?

00:14:58.150 --> 00:14:59.200
I paid for it.

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.320
Where is my incense?

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:03.030
I paid.

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:05.230
Where is it?

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:11.000
Here it is.

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:14.510
Commander, he's here.

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:16.160
Father.

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:17.390
What are you doing?

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:18.960
Don't take my incense.

00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:22.840
Hongzhen Incense.

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:25.720
Father's clearly

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:27.630
addicted to Hongzhen Incense.

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:29.600
What's going on?

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.750
- Commander.
- You're keeping prohibited drugs here?

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:35.030
Commander, I'm innocent.

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.840
He always came alone

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:40.030
and never let anyone in.

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.630
He only tipped a little.

00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:46.000
We know nothing about this.

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:48.000
Who's been meeting him?

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:50.160
I...

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:52.790
I only accidentally saw once.

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:54.790
That person was

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.360
one of the Prince's men.

00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:01.440
Leave us.

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:07.720
It really is the Prince.

00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:18.750
Everyone, see? Was I wrong?

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:21.200
Xu Wanning is unfaithful.

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:22.510
She divorced me, her husband.

00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:24.270
Just so she could be with this man.

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:27.080
Look, everyone, look closely.

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:29.240
She climbed up

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:30.480
to the Marquis family before,

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:32.200
and now she's latched onto the Commander.

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:33.630
Don't forget a few days ago,

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:35.320
even the Prince almost married her.

00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:37.670
Quite a talent, isn't she?

00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:39.200
Could it be the Xu's shop

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:40.750
sells aphrodisiacs?

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:42.280
My friend,

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:43.600
you've got it right.

00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:44.870
I married her back then

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:46.270
because of those aphrodisiacs.

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:49.790
One foolish step, a lifetime of regret.
