The wine money.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.120
Young Marquis,

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.400
what a coincidence

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:52.840
to run into Ms. Chu and you here

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.680
in the middle of the night.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.790
Chu Yu came here to drink,

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.120
and I came to take her home.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.070
Mr. Gu, why are you here

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.450
instead of investigating

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:05.810
today's assassin

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:07.920
at the Court of Judicial Review?

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.710
No need for you to worry.

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:11.890
Once I've found out the truth,

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.130
I will report to His Majesty.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.150
Ms. Chu used

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.280
to like drinking here.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.510
I thought she had only told me

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.630
about this place.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.120
Why are you so upset?

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.290
Did you quarrel with your wife?

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.400
I advise you to take care

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.310
of your domestic affairs first.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.570
If there's nothing important,

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.470
our pleasantries are over.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.080
She is Wei Jun's wife.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.400
Do you really not care

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.520
about this relationship?

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.470
Once Chu Yu entered
the gates of my family,

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.680
she became one of us.

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.360
You're already married.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.750
What gives you the right to say that?

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:09.590
Are you saying

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.520
that you'd get a divorce

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.980
for Chu Yu?

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.150
Your brother is already dead.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.130
She's no longer married.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:17.590
Is your family

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.150
going to confine her forever?

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.630
She could be my wife.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.240
Do you know what you're saying?

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.310
You said it yourself.

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.400
She didn't marry my brother

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.240
because she loved him.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.240
This marriage was just a cover.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.240
Why can't she be my wife?

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:47.030
Yu.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.960
Wei Yun,

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.200
let's go home.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.920
Mr. Gu,

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.470
can you move now?

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.120
When I'm not around,

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.400
don't drink alone.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.040
I know,

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.390
but Rose Dew is so tasty.

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.270
Do you know what a rose represents?

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:51.470
What?

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.310
It represents lasting forever.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.390
Since you drank it with me today,

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:57.360
it means

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.000
that we will always be together.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.520
So, it's settled.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:04.800
We'll be together forever.

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:36.270
When do you think

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:38.560
my brother's illness

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.510
will get better?

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.800
My brother

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.430
could've been a great hero

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.430
on the battlefield, killing enemies.

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:51.400
However...

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:57.400
No.

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.040
He is a hero now.

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.830
He's my hero.

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:07.590
Your Lordship,

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:08.480
you're back.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:12.520
Go and find Wanyue.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:17.960
Go.

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:19.110
Sure.

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.830
I can walk by myself.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.430
The begonias are so beautiful.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:11.520
So beautiful.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:23.640
How about it?

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:25.240
Show me some moves.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.680
Let me see if you've improved.

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:38.080
Flowers

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:40.200

It's okay.

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:01.380
You can use more force.

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:04.870
I'm afraid I'll hurt you.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:31.840
Who

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:36.320
do you see now?

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:55.600
Wei...

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:23.460
(Virtue Shines Brightly)

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:24.720
This white-glazed porcelain vase

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:25.340
is too precious

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:28.680
to accommodate

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:30.840
this single begonia.

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:39.080
This begonia will wither

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:40.630
in this room in a few days.

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:42.440
I know she can stand proudly
in the wind,

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:45.600
but I also hope she has an eave
to shelter under,

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:47.920
not having to suffer from wind and rain

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.200
to bloom freely.

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:51.920
If you like it,

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:53.480
I'll pick up more tomorrow

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:54.320
and give it to you.

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.550
I don't want it from you.

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:57.560
I understand.

00:11:58.600 --> 00:11:59.440
You want it

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:00.750
from Ms. Chu.

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:06.870
Your Lordship,

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:10.870
have you really thought it through?

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:19.560
I know

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:21.900
there is a difference in our status,

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:23.720
but Wei Qiu,

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:25.870
you know

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:27.960
why she came to my family

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:29.860
and why she married Jun.

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:31.260
I don't need

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:33.340
to explain these things to you again.

00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:37.500
Of course, I know,

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:39.860
but the world doesn't.

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:44.660
I've never quite understood

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:47.260
when exactly you started

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:49.220
to have feelings.

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:56.260
When exactly did I start
to have feelings?

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:06.180
I can't answer that.

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:09.260
Does Ms. Chu think the same way?

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:18.540
When it comes to liking someone,

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:19.760
it doesn't require a response.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:22.100
I like her,

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:24.700
but if I focus

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:25.800
on having her like me back,

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:27.820
then my feelings

00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:30.020
would be too selfish.

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:41.340
Don't worry.

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:42.940
I know my limits.

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:46.460
I hope you really do.

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:55.900
Your Lordship,

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:57.820
your ears are so red

00:13:57.820 --> 00:13:59.560
that they look
like they're about to bleed.

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:05.100
I'm saying your ears are red,

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:05.940
not mine.

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:06.820
Get out.

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:41.780
My Lady, you're awake.

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:43.140
Come.

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:45.580
How are you feeling?

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:47.540
Does your head still ache?

00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:51.980
How did I get back yesterday?

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:53.020
You forgot?

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:54.800
His Lordship brought you back yesterday.

00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:58.300
But it's okay.

00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:00.380
He didn't say anything.

00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:01.700
He even

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:02.740
asked me to prepare

00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:04.100
this bowl of sobering soup for you.

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:06.140
It seems His Lordship

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:07.620
cares about you.

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:10.840
Oh, My Lady,

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:12.060
our front yard

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:12.940
is quite lively today.

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:13.860
A lot of people came.

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:16.340
What's the special occasion?

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:17.900
I don't know.

00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:19.820
I heard from Lisheng

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:21.100
that Ms. Jiang

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:22.540
invited many unmarried young ladies

00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:23.780
from the capital

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:24.820
to come early this morning

00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:25.900
to choose

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:28.220
a wife for His Lordship.

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:31.860
Chun,

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:34.160
I have a lot of important things

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:35.000
to do today.

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:36.220
What do you mean

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:37.060
by keeping me here?

00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:37.900
Is there anything

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:39.060
more important

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:39.980
than your marriage now?

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:41.700
You're always making excuses.

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:42.820
If you don't choose,

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:43.820
I'll arrange it for you.

00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:46.820
There's no need to be so anxious.

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:47.740
Yun,

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:49.740
you should take your time and choose.

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:51.340
The young ladies who came today,

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:52.860
whether in terms of their own qualities

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:54.000
or their family backgrounds,

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:55.460
are among the best in the capital.

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:56.380
I don't believe

00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:57.640
none of them can catch your eye.

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:02.300
Fine.

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:03.400
If you don't choose today,

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:05.540
I'll send out invitations every day

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:06.500
and have them

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:07.580
come over for tea

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:09.100
until you find someone you like.

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:10.940
The young ladies are here.

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:19.580
This...

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:33.940
Young Marquis Wei looks a bit fierce.

00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:40.220
Ladies,

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:41.780
Young Marquis Wei is a bit shy.

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:44.380
Yun.

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:53.460
Please sit, everyone.

00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:07.540
Ms. Chu is here.

00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:28.500
Yu, you're here.

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:30.500
Today, I've invited some young ladies

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:31.700
who are still unmarried

00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:33.100
to meet Yun.

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:36.540
When my mother-in-law was alive,

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:38.180
she wanted to do this.

00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:39.460
Since you're here,

00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:40.300
please help out.

00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:42.820
I'm just here to join the fun.

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:43.900
Do as you please.

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:02.540
Greetings, Young Marquis Wei.

00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:04.900
This is the dessert I made

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:06.340
early this morning.

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:08.620
I heard that you prefer light flavors,

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:10.300
so I didn't put too much sugar.

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:13.320
Please taste it and see if you like it.

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:20.660
Yun.

00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:29.060
Should I take it?

00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:35.540
Why not?

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:39.900
It looks

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:41.500
like Miss Zheng is a good cook.

00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:42.980
Taste it.

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:45.640
Or perhaps you should taste it.

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:49.860
Miss Zheng,

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:51.260
you are as beautiful as a fairy.

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:54.260
Yes.

00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:55.500
Also dexterous.

00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:02.020
Then I'll taste it.

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:19.060
Thank you, My Lady.

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:32.300
Chun, I truly appreciate your efforts

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:34.980
in holding this small banquet for me.

00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:39.680
Ladies, I'm not ungrateful

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:41.300
for your kindness,

00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:44.860
but as a general

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:50.260
of Great Sui,

00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:51.900
in these times of war,

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:53.560
I must always be ready

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:55.620
to die on the battlefield.

00:19:57.780 --> 00:19:58.660
And I might die

00:19:58.660 --> 00:19:59.580
in battle at any time,

00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:01.340
like my father and brothers.

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:06.380
How can I marry him now?

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:07.700
Yun,

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.600
how can you speak of yourself like that?

00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:10.500
Yes, Yun.

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:12.520
You mustn't say such discouraging words.

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:13.940
Isn't what I'm saying the truth?

00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:17.780
I will definitely go to war.

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:24.860
If I marry him,

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:27.100
will I really become a widow?

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:29.020
Yes, that's uncertain.

00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:31.380
I don't want to be a young widow.

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:32.220
Exactly.

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:42.660
Chun,

00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:44.480
you've been through it.

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:46.340
You can truly empathize.

00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:50.260
Now, you and Yu are widowed,

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:52.140
with no one by your side.

00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:55.140
Isn't that the truth?

00:20:58.900 --> 00:20:59.740
Yun.

00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:04.600
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)
Lisheng,

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:05.780
see the ladies out for me.

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:22.700
Yu,

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:26.300
did any of the ladies catch your eye?

00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:30.640
Whether I like them or not
doesn't matter.

00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:31.660
What matters is

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:33.620
that Yun likes them.

00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:39.380
So, you're okay with this?

00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:41.940
This is a good thing.

00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:43.300
Why would it not be okay with me?

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:45.100
Yun is already

00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:46.300
at a marriageable age.

00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:47.500
It's not good

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:48.420
to keep delaying.

00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:51.340
If you have any suitable candidates,

00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:53.300
please help Yun keep an eye out.

00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:54.140
Chun,

00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:56.140
haven't I explained to you before

00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:58.080
that this matter cannot be rushed?

00:21:58.180 --> 00:21:59.940
Not everyone is as fearful as you think.

00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:02.780
For example,

00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:04.300
Yu loves Jun so deeply.

00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:05.780
How rare.

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:12.140
Yes.

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:14.380
Such a woman

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:16.660
is indeed hard to find.

00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:23.460
Chun,

00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:24.660
I have my own plans

00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:26.140
for marriage.

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:29.020
Are you saying

00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:31.380
you have someone you like?

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:43.540
No.

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:46.740
Chun, you're overthinking.

00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:49.940
If not,

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:51.340
why didn't you want

00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:52.780
to talk to them a bit more?

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:55.300
You are the Marquis of Zhenguo,

00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:56.900
the backbone of our family.

00:22:57.620 --> 00:22:58.540
I believe you

00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:00.020
have already grown up.

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:18.820
(Chu Mansion)

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:36.180
Linyang, why are you smiling?

00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:38.620
I treat you

00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:39.460
not to make money

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:40.340
from you.

00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:43.340
Ms. Chu Jin's behavior

00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:44.180
just trampled

00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:45.500
on my feelings for you.

00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:49.300
Jin has a strong personality

00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:50.900
and is very sensitive.

00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:52.420
It's not intentional.

00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:55.660
If she has offended you,

00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:58.220
I'll apologize on her behalf.

00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:00.020
Is that okay?

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:02.540
I'm not blaming her,

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:03.550
so I don't need

00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:04.780
your apology.

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:06.740
Just return this money pouch

00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:07.980
to Ms. Chu Jin for me.

00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:09.820
Thank you, Tuantuan.

00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:31.260
It's okay.

00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:33.500
It doesn't hurt.

00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:45.020
What's wrong?

00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:46.800
Why are you so absent-minded?

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:55.100
Linyang, do you know

00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:57.060
that my coming-of-age birthday

00:24:57.060 --> 00:24:58.340
will come next month?

00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:00.460
When I went to the Palace

00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:01.900
to visit His Majesty a few days ago,

00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:04.780
he had already started preparing

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:06.420
my wedding with the Crown Prince.

00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:17.420
Is that so?

00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:20.060
Congratulations in advance.

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:25.580
What's there to congratulate?

00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:27.660
Marrying someone I don't like

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:28.900
isn't a happy event.

00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:31.940
I just regret that I don't have

00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:33.040
Chu Yu's courage.

00:25:33.250 --> 00:25:34.500
Otherwise, I'd also go upstairs,

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:36.040
hang a banner, and throw a flower ball

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:37.680
to marry only the man I like.

00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:43.740
Yu may be bold and unrestrained,

00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:46.020
but she also has her own trouble.

00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:48.060
You really don't need to envy her.

00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:57.540
If I say

00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:00.300
that I'm treating you

00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:01.900
not for the sake of Chu Yu,

00:26:02.573 --> 00:26:04.210
Linyang, would you be willing to marry me?

00:26:12.988 --> 00:26:13.955
What I mean is

00:26:14.673 --> 00:26:16.759
that if I really cure you,

00:26:17.446 --> 00:26:19.066
would you be willing to return the favor

00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:21.423
and help me avoid the marriage
with the Crown Prince?

00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:43.300
You're treating me.

00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:45.540
Whether I can recover in the future,

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:46.860
I should repay

00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:48.220
this kindness.

00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:50.740
But I'm afraid I can't accept

00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:52.820
your proposal just now.

00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:54.620
Linyang,

00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:55.980
do you not like me?

00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:00.140
My feelings for you

00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:01.860
are the same

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:03.580
as for Yu and Jin.

00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:16.060
I...

00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:22.580
I was just talking nonsense.

00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:26.020
Linyang, why take it so seriously?

00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:29.020
Even if you said yes,

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:31.140
I wouldn't take it seriously.

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:52.380
Marriage is serious.

00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:54.020
I dare not treat it as a joke.

00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:56.620
Please forgive me, Miss Song.

00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:19.700
Can you still call me Tuantuan,

00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:21.020
Linyang?

00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:25.140
I have something to do.

00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:27.060
Miss Song,

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:29.580
please go back first.

00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:13.580
(Spring Breeze House)

00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:20.700
I didn't expect you to be

00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:21.540
so good at pitch-pot,

00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:22.700
hitting the target every time.

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:23.540
What a genius.

00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:26.660
That's amazing.

00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:45.060
Oh, you hit it again.

00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:47.820
You have such extraordinary talent.

00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:49.060
You have a good eye

00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:49.900
for talent.

00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:51.620
Others just find it boring.

00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:54.500
Since you're interested,

00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:56.660
why don't you give it a try?

00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:00.820
Come on.

00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:04.900
It's fun.

00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:11.260
Just throw it with force.

00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:14.180
Raise your elbow a bit higher.

00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:15.260
A bit higher.

00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:16.900
Yes, then throw it with force.

00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:17.980
Okay.

00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:21.300
It's okay; it's okay.

00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:25.580
I'm clumsy.

00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:27.380
Sorry about this.

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:28.300
Don't say that.

00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:29.340
If you practice more,

00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:30.620
you'll definitely hit the target.

00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:32.980
Then,

00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:35.900
could you teach me more?

00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:37.220
Sure, sure.

00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:38.300
Of course, no problem.

00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:39.660
It's rare that you're interested.

00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:40.500
Here, hold it.

00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:41.820
Let me teach you.

00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:43.460
Raise

00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:44.460
your hand.

00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:47.260
Pull it back with force,

00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:48.300
and then throw it forward.

00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:49.220
Aim first.

00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:50.520
Come on, hold it tight.

00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:52.380
Pull your hand back a bit.

00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:54.340
Then throw it on the count
of one-two-three.

00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:55.180
Ready.

00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:56.340
One,

00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:57.180
two,

00:30:57.420 --> 00:30:58.260
three.

00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:01.980
I hit it!

00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:03.580
Mr. Song, you're so amazing!

00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:14.900
From now on,

00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:16.380
can I call you Jin?

00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:21.340
Jin.

00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:25.380
Jin.

00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:32.220
It's still early.

00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:33.380
Jin,

00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:34.460
if you're not

00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:36.540
in a hurry to go home,

00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:37.940
would you like

00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:39.080
to go somewhere with me?

00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:42.820
I'd love to.

00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:44.100
The horse ranch.

00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:48.510
There's been a new brown steed lately.

00:31:48.510 --> 00:31:49.360
It's very beautiful.

00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:50.360
I'm sure you'll like it.

00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:54.940
Horse riding?

00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:55.900
Yes.

00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:56.980
I bet you'll love it.

00:31:57.300 --> 00:31:58.300
Let's go now.

00:31:58.470 --> 00:31:59.340
If we're late,

00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:00.900
someone else will get there first.

00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:01.740
Let's go.

00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:03.100
- Hurry.
- Okay.

00:32:11.010 --> 00:32:11.860
Come on.

00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:12.700
Get down.

00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:14.780
Quan'er,

00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:16.860
why haven't we reached the bedroom?

00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:18.340
We're almost there.

00:32:18.650 --> 00:32:19.500
Later,

00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:20.740
let me massage

00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:21.580
and knead for you.

00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:23.740
Quan'er,

00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:24.900
he took me

00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:26.380
to horse riding

00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:27.500
and then to the pitch-pot.

00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:29.660
If it hadn't been late,

00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:31.500
he would've taken me to play Chuiwan.

00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:34.260
This is not sightseeing at all.

00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:36.020
It's clearly training.

00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:37.660
Next time,

00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:38.660
when Mr. Song

00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:39.700
sends an invitation,

00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:40.780
should I just

00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:41.620
refuse it for you?

00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:43.220
Don't.

00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:45.140
A man can't choose the wrong profession;

00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:46.560
a woman can't marry the wrong man.

00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:47.780
For a woman to get married

00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:49.220
is like being reborn.

00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:50.660
In terms

00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:52.860
of family background,

00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:54.120
appearance, and character,

00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:55.860
Mr. Song is top-notch

00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:56.860
in Huajing City.

00:32:57.420 --> 00:32:58.300
Most importantly,

00:32:58.700 --> 00:32:59.940
he doesn't have great ambitions.

00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:02.060
With my skills in managing a husband,

00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:03.600
I can definitely control him

00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:05.140
and make him obedient.

00:33:07.450 --> 00:33:08.300
So,

00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:09.700
if you marry Mr. Song,

00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:11.700
you will be a madam

00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:12.840
in the Duke of Hu's family,

00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:14.620
even surpassing Miss Song.

00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:21.500
The only downside is
that he is unromantic.

00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:23.500
I can slowly teach him.

00:33:23.730 --> 00:33:24.580
Let's go.

00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:25.780
Come on.

00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:26.620
Take it slow.

00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:28.240
Hold on a little longer.

00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:43.300
Tuantuan.

00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:52.260
Anything on your mind?

00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:57.260
Have you ever thought

00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:00.020
about what kind of woman

00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:01.740
you'd like to spend

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:02.880
the rest of your life with?

00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:04.780
Naturally, it's Jin.

00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:06.420
She's so beautiful,

00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:08.540
the top belle in Huajing City.

00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:09.780
Also,

00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:11.260
she can have fun with me.

00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:14.820
Why ask about this?

00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:15.860
Have you had

00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:17.660
someone you like?

00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:22.380
Which young master?

00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:25.140
It's...

00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:27.060
It's General Chu.

00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:28.420
What?

00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:29.700
You're my sister.

00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:31.740
If you marry General Chu,

00:34:32.140 --> 00:34:33.700
I'll have to show you some respect.

00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:34.980
That would be chaos.

00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:36.460
Wenchang,

00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:39.860
General Chu seems

00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:41.140
not to like me.

00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:42.180
What?

00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:44.620
Chu Linyang is just too proud.

00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:45.900
Why wouldn't he like you?

00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:47.460
Tuantuan,

00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:49.780
haven't you forgotten

00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:51.520
that you've been engaged

00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:53.220
to the Crown Prince?

00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:56.740
So,

00:34:57.100 --> 00:34:58.780
does General Chu
having no feelings for me

00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:00.220
have anything to do with that?

00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:07.820
Actually, the problem now

00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:10.620
is not about General Chu's feelings,

00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:13.420
but that you shouldn't have
other thoughts.

00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:14.420
Yes.

00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:17.420
If you like General Chu

00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:18.380
too much,

00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:19.620
when you marry

00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:21.060
the Crown Prince,

00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:22.640
you'll only be more heartbroken.

00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:23.740
Yes.

00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:25.100
So,

00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:27.740
it's better to end it now.

00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:28.580
Yes.

00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:34.180
Let me think about it.

00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:38.340
Tuantuan, why not eat something first?

00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:44.300
It's all your fault.

00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:45.940
Why ask her in the first place?

00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:48.020
She won't even eat now.

00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:19.860
Let me ask you.

00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:21.140
Why did you

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:22.300
make me take

00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:23.540
that lady's dessert yesterday?

00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:27.260
I didn't arrange that.

00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:29.060
Would you reject if I told you to?

00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:31.040
When have you been so obedient to me?

00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:31.980
Why not?

00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:35.340
I understand now.

00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:37.020
You just don't like

00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:37.900
those young ladies,

00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:39.620
so you kept giving me looks,

00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:41.180
hoping I'd help you solve this.

00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:43.180
You're so angry

00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:44.120
because I didn't catch

00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:44.960
your drift,

00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:45.900
right?

00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:49.180
Is that how you understood it?

00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:51.820
How about this?

00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:54.180
Tell me

00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:55.460
what kind of young lady you like,

00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:56.460
and I'll help you.

00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:00.220
Do you really want to help me?

00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:20.620
Do you need me to tell you

00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:24.180
who I like?

00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:42.820
No.

00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:46.140
Who you like

00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:47.220
and who you marry

00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:48.620
has nothing to do with me.

00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:56.180
Auntie.

00:37:58.180 --> 00:37:59.620
- Auntie.
- Lingmo.

00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:01.540
What's wrong?

00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:02.940
They said

00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:05.340
you wrote to Mother a few days ago.

00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:07.100
I miss Mother so much.

00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:09.020
When is she coming to see me?

00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:11.060
If she doesn't come,

00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:12.100
we can go to see her.

00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:13.420
Really?

00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:14.260
Of course.

00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:16.520
Here are some flowers for you.

00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:17.500
Don't be sad anymore.

00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:18.820
Thank you, Auntie.

00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:25.860
Uncle...

00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:27.220
Lingmo,

00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:28.420
you're a little man now.

00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:31.060
You can't accept flowers so casually.

00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:32.280
Got it?

00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:34.940
You're bad.

00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:37.020
You're taking my flowers.

00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:39.060
Why take that

00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:39.940
from a little kid?

00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:41.580
And you're crying?

00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:42.900
Stop crying.

00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:44.280
A man should not shed tears easily.

00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:47.340
Alright.

00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:49.620
Lingmo, stop crying.

00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:50.760
I'll get them back for you.

00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:56.810
- You...
- Let's go.

00:38:58.420 --> 00:38:59.820
I'll take you to see your mother.

00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:02.820
Mine.

00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:04.140
Don't touch.

00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:07.300
How childish.

00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:18.940
Yong.

00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:22.980
As a Yao,

00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:24.020
since you live here,

00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:24.880
you should know

00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:25.740
whose rules to follow.

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:27.920
You've only been married
to Wei Feng for a few years.

00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:28.700
Do you already think

00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:29.540
you're a Wei now?

00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:30.980
I didn't hold you accountable

00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:32.300
for letting Wei Yun go,

00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:34.400
but you dared to enter my study
without permission.

00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:35.660
Tell me.

00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:36.660
What did you see?

00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:38.260
Nothing.

00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:39.100
Yong,

00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:40.660
I've been in this courtyard every day.

00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:41.780
I haven't seen anyone else,

00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:42.940
let alone been to your study.

00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:43.860
Still trying to argue?

00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:47.980
General,

00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:49.340
the Marquis of Zhenguo and Ms. Chu

00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:50.480
have brought Wei Lingmo here

00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:53.260
to see his mother.

00:39:56.620 --> 00:39:58.460
Stay here.

00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:00.500
When they see you,

00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:02.100
if you say anything you shouldn't,

00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:04.260
I'll skin you

00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:06.940
and Wei Lingmo alive.

00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:10.460
Yong.

00:40:10.460 --> 00:40:11.740
I really didn't do

00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:12.860
what you said I did.

00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:13.900
Lingmo is still so young.

00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:15.500
Please, spare him, will you?

00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:16.340
I beg of you.

00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:17.900
Please.

00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:31.500
Young Marquis Wei, Ms. Chu,

00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:33.260
what brings you here?

00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:34.840
Sorry for not welcoming you sooner.

00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:36.340
Have you had breakfast yet?

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:37.780
I'll have someone prepare it now.

00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:39.340
No need for that.

00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:40.540
We came here today

00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:42.420
because Lingmo misses his mother dearly

00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:43.980
and has been crying nonstop.

00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:45.500
So,

00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:46.500
we brought him here

00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:47.980
to see Jue.

00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:49.700
Or,

00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:51.100
if it's okay with you,

00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:52.180
we'd like to take Jue back

00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:53.420
to live with us for a few days.

00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:55.260
What do you think?

00:40:57.940 --> 00:40:59.620
It's truly admirable

00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:01.780
that Lingmo is such a filial child.

00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:03.620
Unfortunately,

00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:05.980
Jue caught a cold a few days ago.

00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:07.980
She might pass it on to the child.

00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:13.580
I really miss Mother.

00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:14.900
Uncle,

00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:17.260
please let me see Mother.

00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:24.380
We know

00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:25.460
you care for Jue.

00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:28.420
Why not let them meet through the door?

00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:30.060
That'd fulfill the child's wish.

00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:31.520
Otherwise, he'll cry,

00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:32.700
make a fuss, and won't sleep

00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:33.640
after we go back today.

00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:40.060
Alright, then I'll take Lingmo

00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:40.900
to see his mother.

00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:41.980
