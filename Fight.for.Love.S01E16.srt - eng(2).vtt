Mother.

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:53.350
Mother.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.960
Jue,

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.510
Young Marquis Wei and Ms. Chu

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:58.980
have brought Lingmo here to see you.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.070
Lingmo misses you so much.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:02.640
Open the door

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.070
and talk with them.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.990
Mother,

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.590
are you inside?

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:15.550
Mother.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:16.750
Mother.

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:19.750
Lingmo,

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:20.800
I'm here.

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:23.430
Yun,

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.520
Yu,

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:25.750
thank you

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.240
for bringing Lingmo to see me.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.870
But my cold hasn't recovered,

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.590
so I can't see you now.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.120
Please take Lingmo

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.960
back home today.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.190
Once I'm better,

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.910
Yong will escort me back

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.470
to reunite with you all.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.360
Jue,

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.470
Lingmo misses you so much.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:50.680
Are you really not going

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.560
to see him?

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:56.430
Mother.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.990
Mother.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.430
Yong, you're so thoughtful.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.080
But if Lingmo

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.590
catches a cold because of me,

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.400
I'll be even more heartbroken.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:07.870
It's better not to see him.

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.150
Mother,

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.710
I'm not afraid of getting sick.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.470
I just want you to hold me.

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:15.870
You haven't seen me

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.120
for many days.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.910
Don't you miss me?

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.150
Of course, I miss you.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.310
Lingmo, be good.

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:42.710
How about I recite

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.470
a nursery rhyme

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:46.310
for you?

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:48.680
After listening,

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.150
you should go back home

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.750
with Auntie and Uncle,

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.990
okay?

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:01.800
I know

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.750
that you're the most well-behaved child,

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.870
right?

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.240
The flowers are fragrant;

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:20.310
the wind is clear.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.240
The bees fly to gather honey.

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:26.680
As the sky turns dark

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.800
and the rain blows,

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.190
the bees are in a hurry
with nowhere to hide.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.750
They fly under the tree
to play hide-and-seek.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.120
Bees,

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.950
don't run away.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.360
Wait under the leaf for dawn.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:52.520
Mother,

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:53.750
don't worry.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.240
I'll be very obedient.

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:03.950
He's also a little man.

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.220
Let him cry for a while by himself.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.410
After all, they'll part ways

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:10.680
when he grows up.

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:16.020
Please stay for some tea

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.830
and snacks before you leave.

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:20.240
Thank you, General Yao, for today.

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.160
Jue, take care of yourself.

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:28.110
By the way,

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.120
the Eldest Princess said

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.000
that in a few days,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.600
she'd like me to bring my sisters-in-law

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:33.040
to see her.

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.360
Jue, take care of yourself.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.000
Well,

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.750
Yu, Yun,

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.360
please look after Lingmo for me.

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:43.270
Sure.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.880
This way.

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.410
You need to talk
with General Yao, right?

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:06.100
I'll take Lingmo and leave now.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.240
Please wait for me.

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:11.670
Let's go.

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:23.920
You were severely injured

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:24.760
in Baidi Valley.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.000
Now, it seems

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:27.860
that you've recovered.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:29.950
The Battle of Baidi Valley

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:31.630
is a pain

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:32.470
in all our hearts.

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:34.430
That arrow at the time

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:36.040
struck right at my heart.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.510
I was truly fortunate

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:39.920
to have survived.

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:42.830
If I remember correctly,

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.260
when Yingzhou fell

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:45.540
and Qingzhou was in great danger,

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:46.950
it was you who spared no effort

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:47.790
to defend Qingzhou,

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:48.830
preventing Great Sui

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:50.240
from losing a fourth city.

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:55.310
One must fulfill one's duty.

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:57.430
As a general,

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:58.560
I'm responsible

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.360
for serving the court.

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:02.790
Indeed,

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:05.020
nowadays, there are few generals left,

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:06.830
and even fewer who can actually go

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:07.570
to the battlefield.

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:09.950
For Great Sui to achieve true peace,

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:11.830
the road is still long.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.600
You must be very careful.

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:18.390
If you make a wrong move,

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.480
it will be hard to turn back.

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:26.240
Your words

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:28.360
have truly pierced

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:29.480
my heart.

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:32.170
Your family has a century
of meritorious service

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:33.630
and is deeply trusted by His Majesty.

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:35.390
Even after losing Baidi Valley

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.510
and 70,000 soldiers,

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.560
you could still inherit

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.560
the title

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.160
and become the Marquis of Zhenguo.

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:44.670
What about me?

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.950
Even if I had great ambitions

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:50.430
and risked my life to protect Qingzhou,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.750
I can only reach my current position,

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:54.360
with no further possibilities.

00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:58.750
It hasn't been easy

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:00.360
for me.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.430
Are you feeling wronged?

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:04.270
Of course not.

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:06.870
I have a sincere heart for His Majesty

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.000
and am loyal

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.430
to Great Sui.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.270
I look forward

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:13.430
to fighting

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.240
side by side with you again.

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:27.830
I also look forward to that day.

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:46.870
He harbors dissatisfaction
with His Majesty.

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:49.120
He once served the Lord of Qin.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.760
Now, he's not trusted and feels wronged.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:52.870
He was not executed

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:54.440
for treason

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.840
but allowed to serve in the army

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:57.720
and earn his merits

00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.510
thanks to His Majesty's benevolence.

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.200
Instead of being grateful,

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:02.270
he dares to do

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:03.240
such unforgivable things.

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:15.960
I understand how you feel now.

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:17.600
We've traced it to this point.

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:19.780
There's bound to be a tragic end
between us and him.

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:21.200
Fortunately,

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:22.720
Great Sui hasn't perished,

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.040
right?

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:26.870
Auntie,

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.080
Uncle,

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.960
the nursery rhyme Mother just recited

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.730
is the one she used to say

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:33.060
only when we played hide-and-seek.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.010
We used to play it
when we visited Yao Mansion.

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:36.840
But what Mother just said

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:39.120
wasn't about the bee in a hurry
to find its mother,

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:41.030
but about hiding under the tree.

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:43.120
I think Mother must be trying

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.320
to tell me something.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:45.440
This is what I found

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.880
under the big tree in the courtyard.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:51.820
(Seven Kun rises westward,)

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:53.420
(locking wood aura in the Xu direction.)

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:00.900
(Virtue Shines Brightly)

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:05.840
My Lady.

00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:07.120
There's no one.

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:07.960
No one's here.

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:11.600
Wait for me here.

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:30.840
Your Lordship,

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:32.270
where are we going?

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:33.480
Is there some urgent mission

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:34.510
to execute?

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.750
Back to the study.

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:40.150
Back to the study?

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:41.510
Why are you acting

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:43.030
so sneaky?

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:46.840
I'm not acting sneaky.

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:49.030
I'm being cautious.

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:49.870
Go.

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:50.910
Fine.

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:53.080
Let's be cautious.

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:44.240
Why do you look like a burglar

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:46.750
breaking into a house?

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:50.120
Chun's been keeping
a close eye on me lately,

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:51.260
as if I have to report to her

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:52.300
everywhere I go.

00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:57.390
Why are you being so secretive?

00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:58.590
I...

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.320
If someone sees me

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:03.720
in your study

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.600
in the middle of the night,

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:07.600
wouldn't they start to gossip?

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:21.360
These two

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:22.480
don't look

00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:23.510
like they are

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:24.600
discussing something,

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:26.030
but rather...

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:27.510
Having an affair.

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:29.960
Why are you here?

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:31.360
I? You...

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:32.360
Mind your own business.

00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:33.590
What did you just say?

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:34.510
- Good.
- I...

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:35.350
Since you've said it,

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:36.420
I'm going to tell Ms. Chu

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:37.070
and His Lordship

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:37.910
right now.

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:39.160
- Wanyue.
- Why?

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:40.970
I remember you asked me
for something before.

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:42.300
Why would I ask you for anything?

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:43.640
You have to take responsibility

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:44.720
for your words.

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:45.560
My Lady!

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:49.940
(The Xu hour on the 7th,
Dingfeng Valley)

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.240
The Xu hour on the 7th,
Dingfeng Valley.

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.390
At the Xu hour on the 7th,

00:12:58.480 --> 00:12:59.710
a rebellion in Dingfeng Valley?

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:02.870
He really intends to rebel.

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:05.380
Yao Yong's been hiding weapons
in his mansion.

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:07.320
Rebellion is clearly premeditated,

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:08.590
but we don't know

00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:09.480
how many people he has.

00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:11.600
No matter how many he has,

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:13.550
we must first rescue Jue.

00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:15.170
If Yao Yong is going to act,

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:17.170
he won't have time to worry
about anything else.

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:18.440
We should take this chance.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.550
I'll go to the Arsenal Bureau

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:23.030
to deploy troops in Dingfeng Valley

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:24.840
and have them pick up Jue.

00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:29.820
We alone might not be enough

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:31.750
for this operation.

00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:33.390
Yes.

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:35.440
Besides the Arsenal Bureau,

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:37.720
we need more forces.

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:43.580
(Eldest Princess's Mansion)

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:15.080
Ms. Chu always has so many tricks.

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:19.840
What are you

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:20.840
up to this time?

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:22.840
Are you trying to get me

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:24.060
to whip you with willow twigs?

00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:25.350
Exactly.

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:27.380
I'm here to atone for my sins.

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:28.840
But I couldn't find

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:29.750
any thorny branches,

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:31.480
so I brought willow twigs instead.

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:33.750
If Mr. Xue can find

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:35.200
a stick or something,

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:36.040
that would be great.

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:06.990
Get up.

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:15.240
Tell me:

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:16.540
What sin are you apologizing for?

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:19.720
I acted before telling you.

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:21.870
But this is of great importance.

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:30.080
Hanmei, go and see

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:31.510
if my medicinal soup is ready.

00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:33.550
Your Highness, Ms. Chu and you

00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:34.870
probably have a lot to talk about.

00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:36.960
Let me stay here to serve you.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:38.660
Xiang is watching the medicinal soup.

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:40.240
I'll feel at ease

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:41.640
if you're with the medicinal soup.

00:15:58.360 --> 00:15:59.360
Now, you can speak.

00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:01.590
Your Highness,

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:03.510
the Battle of Baidi Valley
is suspicious.

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:05.840
After Wei Yun and my investigation,

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:07.280
we suspect

00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:09.040
that the person behind it is Yao Yong.

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:10.080
Yao Yong?

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:12.270
How could it be him?

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:14.000
We've received word

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:16.080
that Yao Yong will take action

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.020
in Dingfeng Valley soon.

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:18.360
We'll prepare in advance

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:19.930
to get to the bottom of it.

00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:22.270
Aren't you worried

00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:23.360
about your own safety?

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:25.850
Your Highness, rest assured.

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:26.840
Though I am a woman,

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:28.270
I will not back down

00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:29.390
in the face of danger.

00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:32.870
A woman as valiant as a man.

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:34.510
I like that.

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:38.270
Before we go,

00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:41.150
I need a favor from you.

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:43.600
My fourth sister-in-law

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:45.150
is trapped in Yao Mansion.

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:47.460
The last time I went to visit her,

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:49.960
I used your name

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:51.080
to intimidate Yao Yong,

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:52.150
saying that you wanted

00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:54.000
to see her.

00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:56.750
But this is not a long-term solution.

00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:58.250
I hope you can take action

00:16:58.250 --> 00:16:59.460
to rescue her.

00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:07.200
I've decided to save

00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:08.950
your fourth sister-in-law.

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:11.440
I can even send a team to assist you.

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:13.110
Young Marquis Wei and you

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:15.000
should go and do what you need to do.

00:17:16.590 --> 00:17:17.610
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:19.350
I knew it.

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:20.510
You're the kindest person

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:21.590
in this world.

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:24.920
Your Highness,

00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:26.550
can you give me an invitation?

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:28.480
Since I've promised

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:29.320
to help you,

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:31.310
you can write the invitation yourself.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:33.840
Your Highness,

00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:35.480
you know how awful

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:36.750
my handwriting is.

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:43.400
Never mind.

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:45.070
If you want me to write it, I will.

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:47.300
It won't be harder
than fighting a battle.

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:53.460
(Arsenal Bureau)

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:54.830
Everyone is here.

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:55.670
Do whatever you need.

00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:57.550
Yao Yong

00:17:57.550 --> 00:17:58.920
leaked my blueprints.

00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:01.200
We will make sure

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:02.040
he pays the price.

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:03.430
Also,

00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:05.240
this is the invitation Chu Yu got

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:06.280
from the Eldest Princess.

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:07.020
(Invitation)

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:08.750
(To Yao Jue)
Go to Yao Mansion on my behalf

00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:09.720
and bring Jue home.

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:11.940
(Awaiting your presence)

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:13.630
Wait.

00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:14.950
Come on.

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:17.720
This handwriting is so terrible.

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:21.110
Who cares?

00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:21.950
It works anyway.

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:24.160
That's true.

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.030
Ms. Chu is

00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:28.750
so amazing.

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:30.270
She got the invitation

00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:32.440
from the Eldest Princess so easily.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.030
It seems the Eldest Princess

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:37.350
favors her quite a lot.

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:42.200
She's always been likable.

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:47.140
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:49.740
(True Might)

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:50.610
Mother!

00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:51.450
Lingmo!

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:54.900
(Defend the Nation and the Throne)

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:56.270
I miss you so much.

00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:57.510
Let me look at you.

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:00.630
Lingmo,

00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:02.590
I will never leave you again,

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:03.430
okay?

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:07.800
Chun,

00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:10.590
find a physician for Jue.

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:11.660
This wound on her face

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:13.080
will leave a scar if not treated.

00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:14.830
Lisheng, go get a physician.

00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:16.070
- Okay.
- Go back to the room.

00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:17.110
I'll be there in a moment.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:18.920
Jue,

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:19.760
let's go.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.270
So, that is

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:28.510
what you've been doing.

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:31.000
It was urgent,

00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:32.550
so Yun and I

00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:33.590
didn't explain beforehand.

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:35.270
Do you have any concerns?

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:39.240
I was just overthinking.

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:42.110
So much has happened in this period,

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:44.270
and you did this without anyone knowing.

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:45.750
Yu,

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:46.590
Yun,

00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:48.160
you were wrong this time.

00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:50.350
I'm sorry.

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:51.720
We were wrong this time.

00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:54.550
It's a matter of great importance.

00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:56.160
We were afraid that if it failed,

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:58.160
it'd only add to your worries.

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:00.070
Luckily, everything was on time.

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:02.440
I'll go see them first.

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:04.060
But in the future,

00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:05.710
no matter how important the matter is,

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:06.920
you can discuss it with us.

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:08.480
Yun,

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.240
we are all part of the family.

00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:11.870
I understand.

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:13.080
Chun, rest assured.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:22.840
Commander Lu,

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:25.620
nice to see you again.

00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:28.440
Thank you this time

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:29.880
for bringing back Jue for us.

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:32.590
It's nothing.

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:34.480
You're truly

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:36.200
a heroine among women.

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:37.510
You don't even mind me

00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:38.680
plotting against your family.

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:40.350
I'm truly impressed.

00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:42.150
Let's forget

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:43.590
the past and start anew.

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:45.030
Let bygones

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:46.510
be bygones.

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:53.770
It seems

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.780
there will be a tough battle ahead.

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:04.620
(Duke of Hu's Mansion)

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:06.200
Wenchang, what are you doing?

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:07.650
I'm going to the Wei Mansion

00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:08.510
to ask Ms. Chu

00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:09.680
to help me with matchmaking.

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:10.960
But I heard

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:12.270
that Ms. Chu and Ms. Chu Jin

00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:13.110
don't get along.

00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:14.880
Aren't you going in the wrong direction?

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:16.510
What does it matter?

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:18.440
She'll be my eldest sister-in-law.

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:20.200
It's always right to build

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:21.140
a good relationship now.

00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:23.670
Wenchang,

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:24.920
this is the fish soup

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:26.160
specially prepared for Qingping.

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:27.110
You took it all.

00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:28.160
Father will scold you.

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:29.590
What do you understand?

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:31.160
Love is priceless.

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:32.520
For Jin,

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:34.270
even if I'm condemned by everyone,

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:35.830
I have no regrets.

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:37.300
Come on.

00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:38.400
Let's go to the Wei Mansion.

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:39.640
Why should I go?

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.240
If Yun is going to take action,

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:42.920
you and I can gang up on him.

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:43.760
Let's go.

00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:53.660
(Dragon Leaps, Clouds Fly)

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:06.190
How is Jue?

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:08.400
Lingmo has been with her.

00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:09.550
She looks much better.

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:12.870
Look at this map.

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:14.960
I went to Dingfeng Valley today.

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:16.340
These locations are suitable

00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:18.220
(Map of Dingfeng Valley)
for deploying troops.

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:19.200
Deploying troops?

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:20.590
What do you mean?

00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:21.430
Here, take it.

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:22.720
Let me see.

00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:27.240
Isn't this the map of Dingfeng Valley?

00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:30.270
You'll deploy troops in Dingfeng Valley?

00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:31.200
Stop shouting.

00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:32.350
Shut your mouth.

00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:33.790
Yun, are you planning a rebellion?

00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:35.640
Are you asking for a beating?

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:36.590
If you shout again,

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:37.930
I'll throw you out right now.

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:40.550
So, what are you

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:41.960
deploying troops for?

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:49.040
Tell them.

00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:55.450
We received intelligence

00:22:56.550 --> 00:22:58.600
that Yao Yong is going to rebel
in Dingfeng Valley.

00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:00.440
We're planning to ambush him there.

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:06.760
I want to go, too.

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:12.400
What kind of expression is that,
Ms. Chu?

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:14.270
I'm from a military family.

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:16.070
Since I was young, I've mastered

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:16.920
all martial arts.

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:17.830
On the battlefield,

00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:18.850
I can take on 100 enemies.

00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:20.640
I'm just low-key

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:21.960
and usually don't show off.

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:24.080
Indeed,

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:26.070
the Duke

00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:27.110
is very strict

00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:28.790
with his martial arts training.

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:30.760
Wenchang,

00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:33.030
Ms. Chu Jin doesn't want you

00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:34.080
to go to the battlefield.

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:36.270
I...

00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:38.110
Since you love archery and riding,

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:39.840
will you go

00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:42.270
to the battlefield?

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:43.920
(Is she worrying about me?)

00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:45.870
So,

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:47.790
do you want me to go

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:49.270
or not?

00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:51.510
You must be joking.

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:53.000
How could I influence

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:53.840
your decision?

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:57.550
My family suffered

00:23:57.550 --> 00:23:59.270
because of the war.

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:02.240
So, I got a bit emotional.

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:06.040
Don't worry.

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:07.410
I won't go to the battlefield.

00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:08.920
My old man

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:10.400
has been retired for many years.

00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:12.030
He won't let me go, either.

00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:17.510
But I've said it.

00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:18.960
It'd be embarrassing to take it back.

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:22.160
If Yao Yong is going to rebel,

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:23.510
he will bring many people.

00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:24.750
I would definitely be

00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:25.680
a help.

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:30.590
Yun, as you know,

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:32.510
I'm just unreliable.

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:34.000
I can fight,

00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:36.160
but I'm not very smart.

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:39.240
Shilan is different.

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:40.790
He's been smart since he was young,

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:41.860
and he can fight, too.

00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:43.870
I don't care. We must take Shilan.

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:46.320
- This...
- Sure.

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:48.510
Then let them go.

00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:50.400
Go back and prepare today.

00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:52.160
Tomorrow, follow me to Dingfeng Valley.

00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:53.350
Follow you?

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:54.590
Are you also going?

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.280
Can't I go?

00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:57.560
I don't mean that.

00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:00.000
Yet you're a woman.

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:01.510
When it comes to fighting,

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:03.160
men are more capable, right?

00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:05.550
That makes sense.

00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:07.110
How about this?

00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:08.310
Let's have a match.

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:10.070
If I really can't do it,

00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:12.750
I'll follow your command
in Dingfeng Valley.

00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:13.590
How about that?

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:15.590
Alright.

00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:16.430
Let's compete.

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:18.320
Come on, move aside.

00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:24.110
Song Wenchang,

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:26.590
why did you have

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:27.920
to provoke her?

00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:35.180
(Virtue Shines Brightly)

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:41.030
Mr. Song,

00:25:41.030 --> 00:25:41.870
let's start.

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:11.440
You're so formidable.

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:14.440
If you're not used to the spear,

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:15.920
you can choose another weapon.

00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:17.110
We can have another round.

00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:18.590
There's no need.

00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:19.680
I've lost.

00:26:20.270 --> 00:26:22.000
Sometimes, admitting others' excellence

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.160
is also a kind of magnanimity.

00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:25.410
Or are you afraid of losing more rounds

00:26:25.410 --> 00:26:26.550
and being more embarrassed?

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:27.400
I...

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:28.310
How about it, Mr. Song?

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:29.520
Can I go

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:30.520
to Dingfeng Valley?

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:31.910
Of course, you can.

00:26:31.910 --> 00:26:32.780
You must go.

00:26:32.790 --> 00:26:34.390
Wenchang, don't be discouraged.

00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:35.780
It's a virtue to admit a mistake

00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:36.420
and correct it.

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:37.650
That's one of your strengths.

00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:40.350
Chu...

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:45.280
Yu had been

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:47.790
practicing martial arts with General Chu
since she was young.

00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:49.590
When you were playing with crickets,

00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:50.750
she could already kill

00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:51.590
the North Qi enemies.

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:53.320
Even I

00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:54.710
might not be able to beat her,

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:55.680
let alone you.

00:26:58.110 --> 00:26:59.510
You should've said that earlier.

00:26:59.510 --> 00:27:00.790
I suffered such a great loss.

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:03.200
I underestimated you.

00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:04.350
I admit defeat.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.270
Ms. Chu, I'll just assume

00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:10.400
you've accepted my food box.

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:12.000
Please speak well of me

00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:14.000
in front of Ms. Chu Jin.

00:27:15.790 --> 00:27:16.830
That

00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:18.960
depends on how you behave.

00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:20.240
A Chu lady

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:21.400
isn't that easy to court.

00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:23.430
Understood.

00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:24.630
Wenchang,

00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:25.950
let's go.

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:27.520
Yun,

00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:29.150
goodbye.

00:27:29.790 --> 00:27:30.790
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:38.780
(Virtue Shines Brightly)

00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:54.190
Chu Yu,

00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:57.830
could you dance with the sword for me

00:27:58.420 --> 00:27:59.990
like you did at the Spring Breeze House?

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:03.080
Can you do that?

00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:07.480
What sword dance?

00:28:08.030 --> 00:28:09.070
A big battle is imminent.

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:10.080
Let's practice.

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:03.560
Chu Yu,

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:05.920
I've been thinking

00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:07.980
that if that day on
the Spring Breeze House,

00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:10.440
the man you were looking for wasn't Jun

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.440
- but...
- It's been a long time.

00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:14.910
I didn't expect you

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:16.310
to still remember.

00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:21.440
Yes.

00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:26.870
I was overthinking.

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:29.720
Don't forget

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:31.410
that we'll soon fight
the decisive battle

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:32.280
with Yao Yong.

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:47.070
(What should I do?)

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:30.490
(15 supply carts sent by General Yao
have entered North Qi.)

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:33.900
(20 spies have been sent
into Great Sui to serve General Yao.)

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:43.200
You came out so quickly.

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:44.040
Guard this place.

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:45.040
Yes.

00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:47.060
(Qinxi Valley)

00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:49.430
Kill him.

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:07.000
Ms. Chu!

00:32:07.510 --> 00:32:08.720
Ms. Chu!

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:09.560
Let him in.

00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:12.440
Ms. Chu,

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:13.750
Mr. Gu might be in danger.

00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:15.640
Please, save him!

00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:16.790
What happened?

00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:17.960
After the auction banquet,

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:19.030
Mr. Gu seemed to be

00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:20.030
investigating something.

00:32:20.790 --> 00:32:22.720
Yesterday, he said he was going to check

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:23.680
at Qinxi Valley.

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:25.880
Before he left, he told me

00:32:26.170 --> 00:32:27.850
that if he hadn't returned
by the Yi hour,

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:29.510
I should come to you.

00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:31.150
He went there alone?

00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:32.430
Yes.

00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:33.320
He said

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:35.070
that if he could find some clues,

00:32:35.070 --> 00:32:36.480
it would help you.

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:38.830
But he hasn't returned for a night.

00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:40.200
He probably

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:42.110
has encountered some misfortune.

00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:43.310
If an official is killed,

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:44.310
the capital should get

00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:45.150
the news immediately.

00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:47.340
There hasn't been any such news so far.

00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:48.590
It seems Gu Chusheng

00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:49.670
is still safe.

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:51.030
But he cannot fight at all.

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:52.400
If something really happened,

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:54.360
even if his life is not in danger,

00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:55.850
he probably won't last long.

00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:56.920
Ms. Chu,

00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:58.310
please save Mr. Gu.

00:32:58.310 --> 00:32:59.240
Please save him.

00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:00.790
Alright, don't worry.

00:33:00.790 --> 00:33:01.920
I'll go find him right now.

00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:04.680
The timing is too coincidental.

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:06.750
It's probably to distract our attention

00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:08.430
and deliberately make us split up

00:33:08.430 --> 00:33:09.400
at this critical moment.

00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:10.310
So, we just ignore him?

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:12.390
No, what I mean is

00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:14.160
that if we have to split up,

00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:15.350
I'll go to rescue

00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:16.430
Gu Chusheng.

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:20.960
But Mr. Gu said

00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:22.830
that Ms. Chu understands him best.

00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:25.400
She is now

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:26.510
part of my family

00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:28.440
and should keep a distance from Mr. Gu.

00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:30.510
Besides, he doesn't know

00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:31.920
that our next move

00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:33.470
concerns the fate of Great Sui.

00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:37.280
The fact that we're willing to save him

00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:39.400
is already out of consideration
for past kindness.

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:41.240
What if you

00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:42.640
take revenge now?

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:43.480
I...

00:33:45.030 --> 00:33:45.870
He won't.

00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:48.880
Yun is not that kind of man.

00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:52.590
How about this?

00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:53.610
When I was at the border,

00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:55.880
I once deployed in a similar terrain
with my father.

00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:56.990
I'll go to Dingfeng Valley.

00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:58.110
As for Gu Chusheng,

00:33:58.110 --> 00:33:59.050
I'll leave him to you.

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:00.180
Take care of yourself.

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:03.550
If someone really wants to kill him,

00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:05.200
he won't be able to escape.

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:07.030
He's still alive,

00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:08.880
so he must be hiding somewhere.

00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:12.320
You know him so well.

00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:15.590
I'm worried about you.

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:26.240
Go.

00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:32.350
Stop.

00:34:33.490 --> 00:34:34.840
I saw you two acting suspiciously

00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:35.680
early this morning.

00:34:36.150 --> 00:34:36.990
Where are you going?

00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:38.880
We...

00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:39.720
Don't lie to me.

00:34:44.590 --> 00:34:45.550
I'm going to fight

00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:46.880
with Yun.

00:34:50.590 --> 00:34:51.430
Wenchang,

00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:53.400
you're finally useful.

00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:54.800
What do you mean?

00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:56.400
When have I not been useful?

00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:58.840
Stop wasting time. Let's go.

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:00.920
By the way, if Father asks,

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:01.760
cover for us.

00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:03.630
Let's go. Hurry.

00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:05.630
How am I supposed to hide this?

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:07.080
Wei Yun,

00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:08.320
Gu Chusheng is good at swimming.

00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:09.340
Follow the water source.

00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:11.140
You'll have a better chance
of finding him.

00:35:11.210 --> 00:35:13.350
The Song brothers will go with me
to Dingfeng Valley.

00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:14.610
We'll intercept Yao Yong there.

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:16.120
You must be careful.

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:17.800
You, too.

00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:41.660
There's only this one water source
near Qinxi Valley.

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:43.510
Perhaps we can find some clues here.

00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:53.220
It seems like someone else
has been here.

00:36:09.590 --> 00:36:10.840
This is an official's uniform.

00:36:11.110 --> 00:36:12.330
It must belong to Gu Chusheng.

00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:14.670
But where

00:36:14.670 --> 00:36:15.760
could he have gone?

00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:22.670
The footprints disappear here.

00:36:23.070 --> 00:36:24.280
He must've been chased here.

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:25.840
To evade his pursuers,

00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:28.220
he jumped into the water
to hide his trail.

00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:31.770
It seems they haven't found him.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.920
When did you know

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:38.840
Mr. Gu so well?

00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:43.190
What did I say wrong this time?

00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:44.190
Everything.

00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:45.030
Shut your mouth.

00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:54.740
(Wood)

00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:57.560
The seal script character for "wood".

00:36:58.320 --> 00:36:59.160
What does this mean?

00:37:00.670 --> 00:37:02.180
Gu Chusheng may leave a secret mark.

00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:03.590
- But that mark...
- Don't worry.

00:37:03.590 --> 00:37:04.380
I've been familiar

00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:05.930
with all the secret codes of Great Sui.

00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:06.820
I will recognize it.

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:08.510
It's probably

00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:09.920
only understandable by him and me.

00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:14.000
A secret code between you two?

00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:15.360
Sort of.

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:16.600
When we were in the southwest,

00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:17.280
he often drew

00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:18.300
local maps.

00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:19.340
Since they were private,

00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:20.800
he used wood, fire, metal, and water

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:22.400
to replace east, south, west, and north.

00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:22.940
Also,

00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:24.360
he'd use seal script.

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:26.400
Wood means the east.

00:37:27.070 --> 00:37:28.510
He's telling me to look to the east.

00:37:32.070 --> 00:37:32.910
Wei Qiu,

00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:34.800
do you still remember the direction

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:36.170
of the Gu family's old residence?

00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:37.760
It's in the east.

00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:49.940
(Gu Residence)

00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:16.110
If I really die here,

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:20.440
it'd be like returning to my roots.

00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:56.480
You're really scared out of his wits,

00:38:56.910 --> 00:38:58.490
not being able to tell friend from foe.

00:38:59.190 --> 00:39:00.190
Are you about to kill

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:01.030
your savior?

00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:02.320
Wei Yun,

00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:03.870
why is it you?

00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:05.990
You look

00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:08.400
very disappointed to see me.

00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:16.000
Even you found me.

00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:17.760
The people tracking me

00:39:18.070 --> 00:39:19.280
should be here soon.

00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:20.840
I'll give you the evidence

00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:21.880
I found in Qinxi Valley.

00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:23.110
Take it

00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:23.950
and leave now.

00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:33.120
Young Marquis Wei,

00:39:33.590 --> 00:39:35.000
this is not the time to be angry.

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:38.420
Take off your clothes.

00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:52.110
If your wound is not re-bandaged,

00:39:52.510 --> 00:39:53.550
you'll bleed

00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:55.590
to death soon.

00:39:57.800 --> 00:39:59.070
This place hasn't been lived in

00:39:59.070 --> 00:39:59.710
for a long time.

00:39:59.750 --> 00:40:01.480
Do you think this medicine
will be useful?

00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:02.320
You...

00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:07.420
What did you give me to eat?

00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:08.390
A coptis pill.

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:09.800
To stop bleeding.

00:40:10.070 --> 00:40:11.210
The right medicine for you.

00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:13.550
You may not want to live,

00:40:14.070 --> 00:40:15.360
but I can't let you die.

00:40:16.110 --> 00:40:17.510
Please cooperate.

00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:24.070
Don't force me to get rough.

00:40:58.070 --> 00:40:58.910
Ms. Chu,

00:40:59.110 --> 00:41:00.210
you said that this gesture

00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:01.200
means to rush down,

00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:02.070
right?

00:41:02.070 --> 00:41:02.910
Is it right?

00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:04.030
With me here,

00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:05.280
why panic?

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:08.110
It's not that.

00:41:08.110 --> 00:41:09.600
I...

00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:12.380
(Gu Residence)

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:16.000
If the coptis pill is effective,

00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:18.630
why am I still bleeding?

00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:21.030
Naturally, I lied to you

00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:23.320
to avoid your endless chatter.

00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:24.670
Naive young man.

00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:26.390
How childish.

00:41:27.330 --> 00:41:28.190
It's not me

00:41:28.190 --> 00:41:29.230
who took the coptis pill.

00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:31.270
Whoever took it knows the bitterness.

00:41:36.110 --> 00:41:36.950
Does it hurt?

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.400
If so, just shout it out.

00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:46.070
A real man

00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:48.190
can handle a little pain.

00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:12.360
Your strength is beyond that

00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:15.110
of ordinary people.

00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:28.030
Where are you going?

00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:31.510
I don't like to wait for death.

00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:34.390
Your pursuers are about to be here.

00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:36.210
You can't ride a horse now,

00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:37.250
so I can't take you out.

00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:38.840
For now,

00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:41.030
I can only use the place you know best

00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:42.800
as a stronghold.
