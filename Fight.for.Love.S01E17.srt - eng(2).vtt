00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.680
Gu Chusheng's pursuers

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.680
must have arrived nearby.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.390
You ride and leave first,

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.510
leaving marks along the way

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:54.400
so Chu Yu can find us.

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:55.680
Also,

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.560
take my horse

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.400
and lead away some of them.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.070
I still can't figure out

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.280
how you found me.

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.070
I've erased all the traces

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.280
along the way

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.920
and only left marks

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.240
for Chu...

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.800
She even told you this?

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.900
(Wood)
You mean that wood?

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.530
I have nothing to hide from Yu,

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.360
so she treats me with honesty.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:18.620
You should be grateful

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:19.910
that she told me,

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.030
or you'd really die here today.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.590
You're so good at taking credit.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.310
What I should be grateful for

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.240
is that Chu Yu
still remembers this code.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.080
The ones

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.030
I should thank most

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:33.280
are the tacit understanding

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.190
between her and me.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:36.590
Why isn't she here?

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.110
There's something more important

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.870
than saving you.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.970
More important than...?

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.060
Has Yao Yong started a rebellion?

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:48.070
Wei Yun,

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:49.660
how could you let her face danger alone?

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.150
If there's no foolproof plan,

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.750
I'd never leave her in Huajing.

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:55.590
Gu Chusheng,

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:56.870
if you can think one step ahead,

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.630
I can think five.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.590
Now, you don't even pretend

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.340
in front of me anymore, do you?

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.870
You should worry more about yourself.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.630
Our current situation

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:07.150
is not safe.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.920
Where are you going?

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:56.400
You're really generous.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.680
It's just material things.

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:59.150
How's it outside?

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:00.470
They've learned their lesson.

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:01.330
They sent in four,

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:02.630
and I deliberately let one escape

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:03.470
to send a message.

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:04.920
Why are you so sure

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:06.560
that these decoys

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:08.270
can fool those people outside?

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.000
Your place is not that big,

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.190
yet they sent in two teams,

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:12.800
one after another, to investigate.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.310
It shows the leader is extremely alert,

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:15.920
but overly cautious,

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.310
which will make him hesitate.

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:18.800
So, I left one person

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:19.640
to send a message,

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:21.310
hoping he would exaggerate.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.310
That'd be our chance.

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:27.680
It's been the Zi hour,

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.100
but Yao Yong hasn't shown up.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.660
Did he sense something was wrong

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:31.740
and change the location?

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:32.870
Yao Jue has broken free;

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:34.000
Yao Yong will surely notice,

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.300
but there are few feasible routes
in Dingfeng Valley,

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.830
mostly in the low-lying valley bottom,

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:38.950
which are easily ambushed.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.920
For safety,

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:41.800
he has only this one route to take.

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:43.150
Someone's coming.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.400
Hurry.

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:48.380
- Mother.
- Don't run.

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:49.220
There are vagrants.

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:51.110
Stop.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.080
Don't run.

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:54.680
It's Yao Yong's men.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:55.520
Stop.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:56.840
- Hurry.
- Ms. Chu.

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:58.310
These commoners

00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:59.390
might not be a coincidence.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.200
How about this?

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.440
I'll take a team

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.700
and go to the back mountain

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:04.760
to form a pincer movement

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.520
so as not to reveal our position.

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:10.680
Charge!

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:11.520
Okay.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.880
Let's go.

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:36.710
This is my first time
on the battlefield.

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:38.510
Though it's not a very big one,

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.040
I'm still a divine soldier.

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:42.100
Don't forget our purpose today.

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:43.240
Stay alert.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.080
Okay.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.920
Form up and protect the commoners!

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:48.910
Yes!

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:10.560
Ms. Chu, you've kept your word.

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:13.560
I let my cousin spread the news

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:14.560
to lure you here.

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.480
There are also the Duke of Hu's sons.

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:19.560
What a pleasant surprise.

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:25.150
Where's Wei Yun?

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:27.120
He doesn't need to come here.

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:28.270
To deal with you,

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:29.310
I'm enough on my own.

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:30.560
Ms. Chu,

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:31.750
don't be too confident.

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:33.240
You're outnumbered.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:34.720
Today, you have no way

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.870
to escape Dingfeng Valley.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:38.510
I'll first send you to reunite

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:40.510
with Chu Jianchang and his daughter.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.600
Then I'll have a go at Wei Yun.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:44.080
Yao Yong,

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:45.830
you colluded with North Qi.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.920
The 30,000 Chu troops in Fengling City

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:49.680
and the 70,000 Wei troops
in Baidi Valley

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:50.820
all perished because of you.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:51.960
Today,

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:54.310
even if I die here,

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:56.360
I won't let you destroy
the peace of Great Sui.

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:57.200
Is that so?

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:58.720
Then let's see

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:00.560
if you have the luck

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.120
to live to that day.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.680
Kill!

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:15.220
General Yao instructed us
before he left.

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:16.830
They first lured Wei Yun and the others

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:17.870
out of Huajing City.

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:19.630
He ordered us to go and support them

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:20.900
so as to launch a pincer attack

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:22.260
and give them a hand.

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:23.520
Yes.

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:27.900
(Yao Mansion)

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:55.870
- Who are you?
- Jiang Chun

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:57.380
from the Marquis of Zhenguo's family.

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.250
Zhang Han

00:08:58.250 --> 00:08:59.690
from the Marquis of Zhenguo's family.

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:00.720
Just you two?

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:01.710
And us as well.

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.200
How come you're here?

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.360
You mean Yao Yong

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:21.750
keeps many private soldiers

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.510
in the mansion?

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:25.970
There aren't many family members there.

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.720
Even with the soldiers

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:28.630
and the servants,

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:30.000
it's only over 30 people.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.720
But lately, they've had to purchase

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:33.240
30 to 50 dan of rice and flour

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.320
every few days.

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:35.550
It seems there are

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.360
over 100 people hidden there.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.480
The weapons

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:39.440
I found in his study

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:41.470
must be for these people.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.440
No wonder Yao Yong is so arrogant.

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:44.900
He's been lying low in Huajing

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:45.750
for so many years.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.600
How well he's been hiding.

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:49.480
But we don't have many troops,

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:51.170
and it's hard to fight on two fronts.

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:54.000
Leave this to us.

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:00.360
You've received the divorce paper.

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:02.120
Why side with outsiders

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.200
against your own cousin?

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:05.970
If General Yao is punished,

00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:07.100
you'll be implicated, too.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.820
Don't bring trouble upon yourself.

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:10.030
I can be

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:12.030
a lady of the Yao family

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:13.840
and the wife of Wei Feng,

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:15.600
but I will never be

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.700
an accomplice to my enemies.

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.440
Don't waste words with him.

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:20.510
They killed my husband.

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.500
They deserve to die.

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:24.900
Charge!

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:27.720
Kill!

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:31.630
With me here,

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:33.940
do you still think you can escape?

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:35.240
Charge out together!

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.840
I'm an old man;

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:37.870
Still, I can fight

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:38.950
with young people like you.

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:57.660
Kill!

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:08.960
Song Shilan,

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:11.720
you even brought reinforcements.

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:13.720
Let me see

00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:16.120
who will have the last laugh.

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:02.150
Today,

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:03.750
thank you for your help.

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:06.200
On behalf of my family

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:07.550
and Yun,

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:08.480
I thank you.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:09.840
Ms. Jiang, my pleasure.

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:12.350
Take him away.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:22.710
This trick won't last over four hours.

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:24.730
There will be a tough battle.

00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:35.300
I may not be able to take care of you.

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:36.560
Can you hold

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:38.630
onto that dagger?

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.150
This bamboo tube contains

00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:11.460
the evidence of Yao Yong's collusion

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:12.040
with North Qi,

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:13.150
proving his crime

00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:14.670
of treason.

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:19.510
No wonder he wants to kill you.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.040
It's not the time for you

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:23.170
to make your last will yet.

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:25.600
Since I promised Chu Yu

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:26.440
to save you,

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:28.440
I will never go back on my word.

00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:30.030
In your eyes,

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:33.630
I'm just a man

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:36.240
who abandoned Chu Yu for power.

00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:38.150
My life is probably

00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:39.840
not as important

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:40.970
to you as this bamboo tube.

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:55.200
Your life doesn't matter,

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.720
but my promise to Chu Yu

00:13:58.480 --> 00:13:59.600
matters greatly.

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:01.270
Have you already fallen

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:04.630
so deeply in love with her?

00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:19.870
Decoys.

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:20.920
Stop.

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.270
Pass my order:
Prepare to break the door.

00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:26.110
Yes.

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:32.320
So many arrows.

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:33.710
There must be a lot of them.

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:35.330
I'll try to hold on as long as I can.

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:36.200
Don't get in the way.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:37.840
The bamboo tube

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:39.080
is with you.

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:40.710
If I don't come back,

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:42.220
leave with the bamboo tube.

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:43.470
If you lose it,

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:45.630
I'll hold you accountable.

00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:48.110
Wei Yun,

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:50.110
with your martial arts skills,

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:51.520
you can easily take the bamboo tube

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:51.960
and leave.

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:53.150
They only want to kill me.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:54.440
I'm saving you

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:56.670
not just because of Chu Yu.

00:14:59.080 --> 00:14:59.920
I hate you,

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.080
but you are a decent official.

00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:04.180
The current court needs

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:05.440
people like you.

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:07.320
So today,

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:10.690
I'm protecting you
for the sake of Great Sui.

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:12.960
Just this once.

00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:56.080
As long as I stand here today,

00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:57.750
you won't be able to open

00:15:57.750 --> 00:15:59.030
the door behind me.

00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:05.870
Archers.

00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:23.590
Chu Yu,

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:25.720
with your current investigation,

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:27.540
you still don't have any evidence.

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:29.780
Today, Wei Yun and I split up

00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:30.960
to bring back

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:32.110
the evidence of your treason.

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:33.720
Ms. Chu,

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:34.860
don't waste words with him.

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:35.830
He's just bluffing.

00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:37.220
The Court of Judicial Review

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:38.180
will make him confess.

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:46.560
I'll count that

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:47.960
as my trophy

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:49.200
this time.

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:51.400
The Chu and Wei spirits

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:52.340
can rest in peace now.

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:54.480
As for when

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:55.560
and how you die,

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:57.710
it will be decided
by the laws of Great Sui.

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:02.910
Yun.

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:04.790
Gu Chusheng is inside.

00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:05.630
Take him away.

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:07.310
We'll deal with the people outside.

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:08.270
Okay.

00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:09.210
Young Marquis, Ms. Chu,

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:10.240
be careful.

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:11.690
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:30.670
Yun.

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:37.610
That man sent out a signal

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:38.450
before he died.

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:40.110
There might be more of them nearby.

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:41.560
Mr. Gu,

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:43.520
what have you discovered

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:45.020
that so many people want to kill you?

00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:46.700
It's the evidence of Yao Yong's treason,

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.170
hidden inside a bamboo tube.

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:49.240
No wonder.

00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:50.680
We'll lead the charge

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:51.520
and break through.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.550
Young Marquis,

00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:05.590
we finally meet.

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:06.800
Who are you?

00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:09.340
(Shen Yu, a spy from North Qi)
That's not important.

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:10.590
What's important is

00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:12.160
that none of you will survive.

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:29.960
Gu Chusheng,

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:30.800
give me the tube.

00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:46.940
Wei Yun.

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:48.030
I don't trust you

00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:49.450
with something so important.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:52.840
Chase.

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:04.200
Time to show our loyalty.

00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:05.440
Kill them!

00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:28.110
Archers.

00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:41.160
You have nowhere to run.

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:42.920
Hand over the tube,

00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:44.510
and I'll give you

00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:45.550
a quick death.

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:49.760
Shoot!

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:10.880
How foolish.

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:13.590
There's a rapid stream down there.

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:16.060
Perhaps it's the only way out

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:17.750
on this dead-end road.

00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:19.730
Dare you take a gamble?

00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:24.150
What?

00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:25.720
You don't trust me?

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:29.320
I do.

00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:33.070
No matter how hard this is...

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:34.830
No matter what happens...

00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:36.720
I'm willing to be with you.

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:39.680
I'm willing to fight with you.

Bring them back, even if they're dead.

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:23.760
Yes.

00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:30.590
Just now, my sisters-in-law and I

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:33.070
have captured all the remnants
of Yao's faction

00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:33.920
in Huajing City.

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:36.640
Huajing City should be safe now.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.560
Uncle, do you know

00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:42.240
that this time it was Ms. Chu

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:43.380
who entrusted me with this?

00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:45.070
Since I got married,

00:23:45.790 --> 00:23:47.850
this is the first time
I've accomplished something.

00:23:48.030 --> 00:23:50.000
You've never forgotten the Wei family.

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:52.830
I haven't forgotten

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:55.000
their code of conduct.

00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:58.160
Uncle, you've always told me

00:23:58.550 --> 00:23:59.510
that their actions

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:00.920
are respectable.

00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:03.240
In these years living with them,

00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:04.440
what I've heard

00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:05.430
and seen

00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:07.240
has really

00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:09.440
touched me.

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:10.590
You're right.

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:12.720
In this world,

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:15.200
everyone's path is hard.

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:17.200
Everyone will encounter many things:

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:19.290
family members leaving,

00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:20.830
betrayal, being framed,

00:24:21.270 --> 00:24:22.260
and hitting rock bottom.

00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:24.520
Everyone will have this moment.

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:25.920
But, Jiu,

00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:28.310
the key is the choice.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.510
Life is a journey of self-cultivation.

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:32.790
To transcend the world,

00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:33.980
one must first engage with it.

00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:35.430
After seeing great sorrow,

00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:37.500
great suffering, and great evil
in the mortal world,

00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:39.610
if one can still maintain
their true self,

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:41.350
that is true goodness.

00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:43.390
Uncle,

00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:45.240
I may not understand now,

00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:47.050
but I'm willing to spend my whole life

00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:48.020
to understand it.

00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:49.960
Well said.

00:24:52.690 --> 00:24:53.240
Your Highness,

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:55.200
the turmoil at Yao Mansion
has been suppressed,

00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:56.570
and Yao Yong has been captured.

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:57.990
You don't need to see His Majesty

00:24:57.990 --> 00:24:59.230
at today's early court session.

00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:01.510
As a general of our dynasty,

00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:03.200
Yao Yong dared to commit treason.

00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:04.630
This matters a lot.

00:25:05.050 --> 00:25:06.600
(Eldest Princess's Mansion)
I must go

00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:07.740
to the early court session.

00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:13.870
Hanmei?

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:17.520
I know

00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:19.200
that you'll go to the Palace today.

00:25:19.450 --> 00:25:20.980
I've heard about Yao Yong's rebellion,

00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:22.850
and there might still be rebels
in the city.

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:24.000
I hope you

00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:25.920
will allow me to escort you.

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:06.590
Hanmei!

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:10.280
Your Highness.

00:26:11.550 --> 00:26:12.920
I'm glad you're safe.

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:15.680
Call the imperial physician!

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:16.520
Yes.

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.040
Hanmei...

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:21.800
Your Highness,

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:23.920
the place where Mr. Xue was injured

00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:26.400
is just a hair's breadth from his heart.

00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:28.550
It's extremely dangerous.

00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:30.480
Whether he will wake up or not

00:26:30.790 --> 00:26:32.590
depends on his fortune.

00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:34.830
In the coming days,

00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:36.350
someone must always be by his side.

00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:56.560
I am a witness

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:01.920
to Lord of Qin's treason

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:02.760
years ago.

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:05.270
Whether he did it intentionally

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:06.350
or unintentionally,

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:08.460
Great Sui paid the price

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:10.000
of three cities.

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:12.790
Since then,

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:15.590
the name North Qi

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:18.590
has become a thorn

00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:20.270
in my heart,

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:24.070
causing it

00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:25.750
to ache terribly.

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:30.310
That day in Qinxi Valley,

00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:31.830
the items from North Qi were found.

00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:34.590
How could I not be suspicious?

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:39.000
But today, you...

00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:48.440
I can't remember which day it was

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:50.880
that you volunteered to come

00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:53.470
and risk your life
to gather herbs for me,

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:55.240
saying you wanted to heal my injuries.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.270
What medicine can't I find?

00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.550
Why go up the mountain yourself

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.110
and get hurt like this?

00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:07.030
This herb only grows

00:28:07.030 --> 00:28:08.200
on cliffs and steep walls.

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:10.400
No one will risk their life
to gather it.

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:12.040
But for you,

00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:13.750
the risk is nothing.

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:23.110
I command you:

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:24.920
Never to gather herbs again.

00:28:25.510 --> 00:28:26.350
Your Highness,

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:28.760
I'm hurt.

00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:32.240
How could I not understand

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:34.750
that as long as I stay away from love,

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:36.550
I won't get hurt?

00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:40.270
How could I possibly like you?

00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:51.750
And yet today,

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:54.160
you risked your life

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:55.000
to save me.

00:28:58.270 --> 00:28:59.590
I shouldn't doubt you anymore.

00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:03.350
Hanmei,

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:05.920
I'll stay right here with you.

00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:09.310
I want to see you wake up.

00:29:13.790 --> 00:29:14.680
Do you hear me?

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:28.270
If her attendant

00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:29.740
hadn't protected her from the blade,

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:32.030
I would've lost Changming.

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:34.480
Huang Quanyou,

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:36.200
pass on my imperial decree.

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:38.440
Make sure to get Yao Yong to talk

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:41.240
and root out every last remnant

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:42.830
of North Qi in Huajing City.

00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:47.140
(Huajing City)

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:49.200
Thanks. I can't eat.

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:02.310
Don't worry.

00:30:02.750 --> 00:30:04.110
Young Marquis Wei and Ms. Chu

00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:05.200
are not easy targets.

00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:06.960
A few spies won't be able

00:30:07.270 --> 00:30:08.220
to do anything to them.

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:09.240
Here, eat something.

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:12.440
Eat something.

00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:13.600
Look at yourself.

00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:15.000
You're more worrisome than they are.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:15.870
Young Master,

00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:17.200
it seems someone is coming back.

00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:22.670
Where's Yu?

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:26.100
General Chu,

00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:27.200
it's just a short distance.

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:28.110
What's the rush?

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:31.750
We're finally back.

00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:34.510
Chusheng,

00:30:34.510 --> 00:30:35.400
can you hold on?

00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:37.350
It's okay; don't worry about me.

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:39.120
We need to get back to Huajing asap

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:40.270
to inform the others

00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:41.820
to find Chu Yu and Wei Yun.

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:42.720
Okay.

00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:49.030
Mr. Song,

00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:49.920
where's Yu?

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:50.760
Wei Yun and she

00:30:50.770 --> 00:30:51.810
went towards Pingjin Cliff

00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:53.160
to draw the pursuers away.

00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:54.890
General Chu, please take some men

00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:56.110
to support them.

00:30:56.110 --> 00:30:56.960
They went alone?

00:30:58.250 --> 00:30:59.390
How many pursuers are there?

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:00.280
About 20 to 30,

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:01.280
including archers.

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:03.510
Chu Shan, Wanyue,

00:31:03.510 --> 00:31:04.350
Wei Qiu,

00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:05.790
follow me to provide support.

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:07.320
Commander Lu...

00:31:07.550 --> 00:31:08.510
I'm precious.

00:31:08.790 --> 00:31:10.480
Promise me some wine every day

00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:11.880
- until I vomit.
- Then forget it.

00:31:12.550 --> 00:31:13.390
I'm just joking.

00:31:13.550 --> 00:31:14.390
I'll go with you.

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:16.000
I'm at your service.

00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:17.550
If you fall on the way,

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:19.240
Ms. Chu will surely beat me up.

00:31:19.790 --> 00:31:20.630
I'll go, too.

00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:22.310
Mr. Song,

00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:24.110
since Yu has entrusted Mr. Gu to you,

00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:24.950
please ensure

00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:26.960
his safe return to Huajing.

00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:28.240
The Duke of Hu

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:29.920
has been waiting
for you and your brother.

00:32:00.550 --> 00:32:01.390
Commander,

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:05.750
one of them is injured.

00:32:06.270 --> 00:32:07.640
They must be hiding nearby.

00:32:08.270 --> 00:32:09.240
We cannot let them

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:10.200
escape again.

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:11.800
Keep searching.

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:27.240
Chu Yu?

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:32.800
Chu Yu...

00:32:33.510 --> 00:32:34.350
Chu...

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:44.720
Wei Yun,

00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:48.390
you're awake.

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:50.720
Don't move.

00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:52.520
How are you?

00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:54.470
Is your leg in too much pain?

00:32:58.440 --> 00:32:59.280
No, it isn't.

00:33:02.830 --> 00:33:03.920
Where did you just go?

00:33:04.790 --> 00:33:05.830
I went out to see

00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:07.160
if there were any useful herbs,

00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:08.640
but it was pouring rain outside

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:09.510
and too dark.

00:33:09.510 --> 00:33:10.500
I couldn't find anything.

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:13.110
But I found something else good.

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:19.200
I can make grilled fish for you.

00:33:21.550 --> 00:33:22.390
I'll help.

00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:23.520
No need.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:24.920
Just stay here.

00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:25.760
I'll take care of it.

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:27.040
Sit still.

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:09.280
I don't know when Linyang

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:10.510
will find us.

00:34:11.150 --> 00:34:12.230
It won't be that easy.

00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:14.510
I don't know if you like fish.

00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:16.800
Let's just fill our stomachs first.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.280
Once you regain some strength,

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:19.320
we'll go out

00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:21.920
and see if there's a village nearby.

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:23.910
We'll find a physician for you first.

00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:50.300
Though the Yao remnants
have all been captured,

00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:51.960
the Eldest Princess was still attacked

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:52.880
outside her mansion,

00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:54.510
causing panic in Huajing.

00:34:55.150 --> 00:34:56.030
Yao Yong's fate

00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:58.070
needs to be decided asap.

00:34:58.920 --> 00:34:59.760
Where is Yao Yong?

00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:15.000
Isn't this Mr. Gu?

00:35:15.590 --> 00:35:17.670
What an honor to have you

00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:19.960
preside over my case.

00:35:20.590 --> 00:35:21.550
You don't look surprised

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:23.200
that I'm still alive.

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:27.030
Your butler has confessed to everything.

00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:29.190
You colluded with North Qi,

00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:31.000
stole military secrets,

00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:32.710
killed Wei generals

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:34.550
and the Wei Army,

00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:37.130
and caused chaos in Huajing
with the intention of rebellion.

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:38.190
Each of these charges

00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:39.370
is backed by solid evidence.

00:35:39.550 --> 00:35:40.510
Yao Yong,

00:35:40.510 --> 00:35:41.760
if you confess truthfully,

00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:43.630
I can plead for your family

00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:46.550
to be spared.

00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:54.630
Why would I kill you?

00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:56.550
Well.

00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:58.550
The winner takes all.

00:35:59.630 --> 00:36:01.000
Since I'm here now,

00:36:01.590 --> 00:36:02.920
you can say

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:05.320
whatever you want.

00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:06.750
You set a trap for Chu Yu

00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:08.480
and Wei Yun in Dingfeng Valley

00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:11.130
and sent assassins to kill me
in Qinxi Valley.

00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:12.400
That day,

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:13.920
I didn't reveal my whereabouts.

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:16.070
How did you know?

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:47.680
Wei Yun,

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:49.240
how are you feeling?

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:55.840
So hot.

00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:57.680
Wei Yun.

00:36:58.360 --> 00:36:59.200
Wei Yun,

00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:00.440
can you hear me?

00:37:01.110 --> 00:37:01.950
Wei Yun,

00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:03.710
talk to me.

00:37:03.710 --> 00:37:04.630
Wake up.

00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:06.030
Wei Yun, can you hear me?

00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:06.870
I'm cold.

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:08.200
Cold?

00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:29.130
How are you feeling now?

00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:30.840
Do you feel better?

00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:34.810
I won't let anything happen to you.

00:38:02.590 --> 00:38:03.430
Wei Yun.

00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:21.550
Wei Yun.

00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:25.550
Wake up, Wei Yun.

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:32.600
Wei Yun.

00:38:35.550 --> 00:38:36.390
I'm sorry.

00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:39.510
I'm so sorry.

00:38:42.590 --> 00:38:43.840
At Pingjin Cliff,

00:38:44.670 --> 00:38:45.510
I...

00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:48.030
We were

00:38:48.030 --> 00:38:49.280
out of options.

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:52.110
I had no choice

00:38:54.070 --> 00:38:55.110
but to gamble with you.

00:38:56.510 --> 00:38:57.350
I...

00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:03.510
When you wake up,

00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:06.000
I'll never gamble again.

00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:08.630
Whether it's a hail of arrows

00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:10.710
or a sea of fire,

00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:13.070
I'll go through it with you.

00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:15.710
- Wei Yun.
- So cold.

00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:17.360
Cold?

00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:18.200
I'm cold.

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:22.680
Here.

00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:31.510
Do you feel better?

00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:37.640
Wei Yun,

00:39:43.070 --> 00:39:43.910
please.

00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:46.240
I beg you.

00:39:48.590 --> 00:39:49.430
For...

00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:51.200
You can't...

00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:53.110
I beg you, Wei Yun.

00:39:53.110 --> 00:39:53.950
Wake up.

00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:56.870
You promised to be with me on this road.

00:39:57.360 --> 00:39:58.800
You can't leave me alone.

00:40:01.070 --> 00:40:01.910
Please,

00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:05.280
wake up.

00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:10.360
I beg you.
