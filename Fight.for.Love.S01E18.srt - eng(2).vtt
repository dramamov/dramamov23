00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.710
I'm begging you, Wen Yun.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:46.790
Wake up.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.960
Wen Yun.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.120
How do you feel?

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.280
Since when

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.280
did you become so chatty?

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.080
Just for the people?

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:27.800
Of course.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.080
What else could it be for?

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.590
What if it was for you?

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.750
It was certainly for me.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.360
If something happened to you,

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.120
what would I tell your family?

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.000
And I'd be seen as a traitor to the nation.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.520
Don't worry.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.360
I'm not going to die that easily

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.310
before I've had my revenge.

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:38.590
And for you,

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:44.750
I must survive.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.840
What do we do?

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.310
We tracked all this way

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:34.750
but have found no trace.

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:36.630
Only this cliff is unsearched.

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.630
They couldn't have
jumped down, could they?

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.920
There's a waterway down below.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.560
Her Ladyship knows that.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.680
Maybe too many pursuers were running

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.560
after the two of them.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:52.760
Jumping is risky,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.430
but it's possible they survived.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.120
Wanyue,

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.240
that's Young Marquis Wei Yun.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.920
He always moves carefully.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.510
Why would he risk their lives?

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:06.520
Strategies vary.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:07.540
His Lordship

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:08.510
isn't opinionated.

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:10.270
That's right.

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:15.800
General,

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:16.800
we've checked everywhere.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000
We found no other traces.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.160
Any good idea, Commander Lu?

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:37.560
General Chu,

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:38.760
you're clever.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.200
Let's go.

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:43.160
Don't worry.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.680
I'm clever enough

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.870
to handle all of this.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.120
I promise I'll bring them back

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.960
safe and sound.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:54.560
Look at this.

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.950
A compass?

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:00.160
You have fine taste.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.160
But this compass

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.120
I designed

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:05.720
is quite different from ordinary ones.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.560
As people say,

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.750
harmony brings good fortune,

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.080
while discord

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.560
brings ruin.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.000
Watch carefully.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.510
The compass needle

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:26.240
isn't moving erratically.

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:28.270
That means...

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.270
There's no evil around.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.360
No need to worry, guys.

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:37.040
Go check over there.

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.240
Weird stuff.

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:42.110
General,

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:43.920
what should we do next?

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:46.880
Search carefully.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:06:59.960
The needle...

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:00.960
I...

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:05.960
Well...

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.160
It's moving erratically.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.160
But you all heard

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.560
what Wanyue just said.

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:12.160
There's rushing water down below.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.040
Maybe they will land...

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.270
On their feet.

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:28.710
Wanyue,

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:29.920
you know this area best.

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:31.560
Lead the way down.

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:33.270
Yes.

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:34.350
Let's go.

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:38.600
I have a new idea.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:40.960
What?

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:42.960
General Chu, wait for me.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:53.760
Wen Yun.

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:55.510
Wen Yun, you can't sleep.

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:57.160
You must stay awake.

00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:58.560
Hang in there.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:03.120
How about you talk to me? Alright?

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:03.960
Let's talk.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:08.960
- Careful.
- Alright.

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:13.670
Be careful.

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.360
If you have nothing to say,

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:32.360
then I will ask.

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:35.720
You can't cook.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:37.510
But your grilled fish

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:38.350
tasted great.

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.200
Learned from your father?

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:43.440
Of course.

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:47.960
When we were at the border,

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:49.840
we couldn't have any meat

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.000
until the Spring Festival.

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:52.270
So,

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:53.630
my father caught fish in the river

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:54.870
and forbade everyone else

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:56.200
from taking my food.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:58.480
Gradually,

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.030
I learned from him

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:01.360
how to roast fish.

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:04.200
I couldn't do that as well as he.

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:05.630
But tell me.

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:07.720
Did that fish taste great?

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:08.840
Of course.

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:10.630
It was so tasty.

00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:17.600
You're like your father.

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:20.960
He said the same thing.

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:22.960
According to my father,

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:24.510
I was most like him

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:25.960
among all his children.

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:27.350
How?

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:30.840
I have no ambitions, just like him.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.510
All I want is peace and quiet,

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.630
so I can live a simple,

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:37.720
carefree life.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.200
I remember my father asked me

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.360
whether I wanted to get married

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:45.840
or do something else.

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:47.630
I told him

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:49.960
I would find a place

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:51.720
that few people knew.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:53.960
There was natural beauty

00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:55.240
and fine weather.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:58.550
A house would shelter me from the rain.

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:01.030
A yard would allow me
to gaze at the stars.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:03.960
Regular meals would be enough.

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:07.960
Now,

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:09.750
I also want Xiaoqi to be around.

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:12.480
Xiaoqi?

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.150
It's a cute puppy

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:18.360
and doesn't bark.

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:20.510
It also helps me shoo away sparrows.

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:21.960
Adorable, isn't it?

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:28.440
Oh, yeah, the puppy.

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:33.510
Or...

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:35.270
Or what?

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:53.350
Yu.

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:57.320
I like you.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.270
I warned myself not to.

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:05.960
But I just can't help

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:06.840
loving you.

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:10.480
Actually, most of the time,

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:14.360
I'm jealous of the puppy

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:15.200
named Xiaoqi.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.150
I never dared to say it.

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:20.630
But under the circumstances,

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:24.480
I have to tell you.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.270
Then, even if I die,

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:34.360
I won't have regrets.

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:48.240
I want to be a part

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:51.200
of your future.

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:57.990
Yu.

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:03.800
Please tell me.

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:08.720
Will you accept me?

♪I keep all my feelings to myself♪

00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:16.680
♪Why is our story filled with sorrow?♪

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:21.680
♪Memories drift with the winds♪

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:26.610
♪Over the years, I've been missing you♪

00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:32.180
♪I never complain, but keep waiting♪

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:11.230
You're awake.

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:12.510
How do you feel?

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:16.720
Great. Your fever is gone.

00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:20.350
The sun is out.

00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:21.720
So, the rain stopped.

00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:23.480
Come on. Let's go out.

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:26.000
I need to get you a physician.

00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:27.230
Come on.

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:31.960
Your leg hurts, right?

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:34.110
Then...

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:49.040
Who's there?

00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:10.750
Well,

00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:11.590
don't be scared.

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:12.720
I'm not a bad person.

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:16.750
And you are...?

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.510
I'm from a nearby village.

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:21.720
My name is Shen.

00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:24.030
This forest is very remote.

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:25.270
Few people come here.

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.070
Compared to me,

00:17:27.070 --> 00:17:28.510
strangers like you

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.350
seems more suspicious.

00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:37.590
We are...

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:40.400
My wife Yu and I

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:41.760
are from Qingzhou.

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:43.880
We were on our way
to see relatives in Huajing City.

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:45.590
When we were passing Pingjin Cliff,

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:47.440
we encountered some bandits

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:48.720
who were killing and robbing.

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:50.160
They robbed us

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:51.200
of all our belongings

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:53.270
and even pushed us off the cliff.

00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:55.150
Luckily,

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:57.030
we fell into the pool

00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:58.640
and barely survived.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:00.920
But my leg was hurt.

00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:16.680
I wonder if there's a physician

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:17.670
in your village.

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:23.830
How about you go to my house

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:25.070
and figure it out?

00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:49.160
Lady Yu,

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:51.680
please remove the bandage

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:52.960
from your husband's wound

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:55.270
and let me check the condition.

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:13.800
Don't move.

00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:26.070
Why is it so severely bruised?

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:28.960
Don't worry too much.

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:30.960
The wound is just too deep.

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:32.480
Fortunately, the bleeding

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:33.640
stopped in time.

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:35.440
The bruises look horrible,

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:37.590
but his leg can be saved.

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:40.070
If the treatment was delayed,

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.400
your husband couldn't survive

00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:43.350
unless his lower leg was amputated.

00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:47.950
Ms. Shen,

00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:49.880
my wife is delicate.

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:51.640
Please don't scare her.

00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:55.390
Don't move.

00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:59.070
I'm just a villager,

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:00.440
but I've seen

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:01.280
a more severe wound.

00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:03.480
Without timely treatment,

00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:05.000
that man lost his lower leg.

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:06.750
I know.

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:08.440
You don't want your wife to be worried.

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:09.590
But if you refuse

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:10.590
to receive treatment,

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:11.790
your minor injury

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:12.840
will end up serious.

00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:15.200
Ms. Shen,

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:16.960
is there a cure?

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:19.510
I know a massage technique

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:21.240
to unblock the congested blood vessels.

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:22.590
With good blood flow,

00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:23.750
his leg would be all right.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.830
It sounds simple.

00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:27.750
But...

00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:28.590
It's all right.

00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:30.920
Do we need

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:32.200
some rare herbs?

00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:33.430
Tell me.

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:35.110
I will get them

00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:36.200
at whatever cost.

00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:40.550
It takes a lot of effort

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:42.160
to clear the blockage.

00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:43.960
It takes a lot of strength.

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:45.750
Two hours is needed for a day.

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:46.760
And it must be done

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.160
for several consecutive days.

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:50.400
If you want to try,

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:52.200
I will teach your wife

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:53.160
how to massage.

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:54.640
You'll massage your husband.

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:01.200
My wife is weak

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.240
and has little strength.

00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:03.830
Ms. Shen, you must know

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:05.000
some men in your village.

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:06.240
Please invite someone

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:07.080
to massage me.

00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:08.110
I'll pay him well.

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:09.920
The massage therapy

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:11.270
will take more than a day.

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:13.030
No one else

00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:14.590
can help you as handily as Lady Yu.

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:16.240
Besides,

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:17.960
your leg is a private part.

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:20.270
If a stranger massages you,

00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:22.240
he'd feel awkward,

00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:23.830
even if you are a man.

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:26.830
You're a couple, anyway.

00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:28.270
You've been intimate before.

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:29.510
No need to be shy.

00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:38.400
Right.

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:39.550
You're right, Ms. Shen.

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:41.200
No one

00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:42.920
will take care of him

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:43.760
like I will.

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:45.310
You teach me, then.

00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:47.350
Alright.

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:51.000
I... Umm...

00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:54.030
Let's get in there.

00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:54.870
Alright.

00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:51.790
You have a great memory.

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:54.270
You picked it up so quickly.

00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:55.680
In that case,

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:56.520
I'll be going then.

00:22:56.790 --> 00:22:58.200
Today, massage him for another hour.

00:22:58.550 --> 00:22:59.400
Do it for a few days

00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:00.830
and your husband's leg

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:01.790
will be all right.

00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:02.720
Thank you, Ms. Shen.

00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:16.830
So, you pretended it didn't hurt.

00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:22.350
Who said that?

00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:25.270
It's just hot in here.

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:36.350
Are you in pain?

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:38.800
No.

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:40.760
No?

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:45.920
Why can't you feel anything?

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:48.080
Don't worry.

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:50.310
Even if I were to lose my leg,

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.480
I would still be a great man.

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:53.920
What are you talking about?

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:56.160
That's not what worries me.

00:23:57.750 --> 00:23:59.960
I fear I may massage you wrongly.

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:01.640
If you really lose this leg,

00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:02.960
what will you do?

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:09.830
Well, in that case,

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:12.030
I'd still be the marquis

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:13.880
who had no ambitions.

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:15.920
I'd take you to Sishui

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:18.310
and stay there as a local gentry.

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:19.560
Don't be ridiculous.

00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:21.240
By then,

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:22.440
no one would want to marry you.

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:24.160
I never planned on marrying anyone.

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:26.830
I just want you around.

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:34.310
How about you feed me?

00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:36.960
For a lifetime.

00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:54.310
We'll bring the rest of the family.

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:56.480
Xiaoqi will go, too.

00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:58.720
I think we can

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:00.790
all stay there

00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:02.190
as local celebrities.

00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:05.070
You have no ambition at all.

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:08.070
No one would even believe it.

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:13.160
I won't let it go

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.000
until I see Yao Yong dead.

00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:17.350
That guy lurked

00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:19.200
in Huajing City for many years.

00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:21.310
He has powerful backers.

00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:22.680
If we hadn't found

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:23.520
enough clues,

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:24.720
those people would

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:26.070
have devoured Huajing City.

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:29.440
When we go back,

00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:31.030
we must uncover his backers.

00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:32.720
He was so treacherous
even in the capital

00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:34.790
and killed so many people.

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:37.680
I must kill him myself.

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:40.030
So far,

00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:41.790
this village seems safe.

00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:43.400
Later, I'll think of a way

00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:44.720
to send word to my brother

00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:46.200
and reassure him.

00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:52.000
Tomorrow...

00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:53.440
Tomorrow, we'll go back.

00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:23.920
Actually, I think

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:25.000
that's enough for today.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:25.920
I feel much better.

00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:29.920
Yeah. I also think

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:31.200
that's enough time.

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:39.110
You should get some rest.

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:40.920
I'll go get you some food.

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:43.240
Yeah. It will get my strength back.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:50.840
Alright.

00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:03.590
Chu Yu,

00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:05.070
what on earth

00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:06.480
were you thinking of?

00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:08.750
That was treatment.

00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:10.000
You were helping Wen Yun.

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:37.000
Ms. Shen.

00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:38.350
So, you can not only hunt

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:39.680
but also fish.

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:42.270
Madam Wang next door

00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:43.110
asked me to fix this.

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:45.000
Her husband and son died at a young age.

00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:46.110
Usually,

00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:47.640
she makes a living by fishing

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:48.550
in the river out there.

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:50.590
Fish in that river are small.

00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:52.240
Other nets aren't available.

00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:53.790
So, every time the net is torn,

00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:55.200
I'll mend it for her.

00:27:55.550 --> 00:27:57.240
Such a talent, Ms. Shen.

00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:59.550
Did you make all these things, too?

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:02.070
Oh, these things.

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:03.790
My husband Cui made them.

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:05.040
Look.

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:06.550
He made this dustpan

00:28:06.550 --> 00:28:07.830
for Mr. Li.

00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:09.910
He made this chair

00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:11.200
for Madam Lin.

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:12.720
And that one...

00:28:16.510 --> 00:28:17.350
Look.

00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:18.590
With so many things around,

00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:19.440
I just can't remember.

00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:21.200
Many old people

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:22.200
live in this village.

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:24.000
Very few villagers are of my age.

00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:25.830
So, we help them

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.110
as much as we can.

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:30.160
What about their families?

00:28:30.410 --> 00:28:31.270
They're not here?

00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:32.110
They joined the army.

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:33.880
There have been wars.

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:35.680
Soldiers are from almost every family.

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:40.310
If Cui's leg...

00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:43.400
He would also be on the battlefield.

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:50.070
So, Mr. Cui is the man

00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:51.000
who was amputated?

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:55.830
Sorry, I...

00:28:56.030 --> 00:28:56.870
It's fine.

00:28:57.310 --> 00:28:58.920
Neighbors help each other.

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:01.070
That's not just in our village.

00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:02.790
It's more common in border towns.

00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:05.030
Their fathers, brothers, and sons

00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:06.030
are heroes who fought

00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:07.350
to defend our nation.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.270
Cui and I feel happy

00:29:10.550 --> 00:29:12.110
when we can help them.

00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:15.150
Before,

00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:16.510
North Qi didn't take

00:29:16.510 --> 00:29:17.920
three cities from our nation.

00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:19.820
Qingzhou and Fengling City

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:21.400
didn't use to be border areas.

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:23.680
Huajing City was relatively safe, too.

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:25.960
But now...

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.070
People won't be happy

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:32.590
unless the war finally ends.

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:38.040
It will end.

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:39.680
It will someday.

00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:50.920
How's your husband's leg?

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:03.400
I massaged him,

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:05.200
and I think it helped.

00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:07.830
Oh, Ms. Shen.

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:09.920
Is there a way to send a message

00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:11.200
to the town?

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:12.920
We're leaving tomorrow.

00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:14.880
But he has difficulty walking.

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:16.240
So, I want to send word

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:17.200
to my relatives in town

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:18.440
and ask them to meet us.

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:20.280
There is a way.

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:22.200
But your husband's leg

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:23.070
hasn't recovered.

00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:24.200
He needs to rest for days.

00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:26.720
And there has been bad weather lately.

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:27.750
If his wound gets wet

00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:28.920
in the rain,

00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:30.310
it could get worse.

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:37.110
Actually, our village is remote enough.

00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:39.030
Those bandits won't come here.

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:41.030
Why don't you stay here

00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:42.110
until his leg recovers?

00:30:43.790 --> 00:30:44.750
We can never

00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:45.590
be too careful.

00:30:45.790 --> 00:30:47.200
The bandits want money.

00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:48.350
When they fail

00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:49.680
to get anything valuable here,

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:51.000
they will leave.

00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:54.160
You don't need to worry.

00:30:54.550 --> 00:30:55.720
Feel free to stay here.

00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:00.080
In that case,

00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:02.240
we'll gladly accept your help.

00:31:12.510 --> 00:31:13.350
This way.

00:31:43.550 --> 00:31:44.390
The grilled fish

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:45.920
is my father's special dish.

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:48.240
It must be Yu who made it.

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:51.830
It must be her.

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:54.280
What did I say?

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.070
See?

00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:57.790
I told you my compass

00:31:57.790 --> 00:31:58.720
would help.

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:00.400
Don't worry.

00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:02.200
The two of them must be alive.

00:32:02.790 --> 00:32:03.920
We'll keep searching for them

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:04.790
along the waterway.

00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:06.640
Soon, we'll find them.

00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:10.480
Let's go.

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:13.510
Trust me

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:16.440
and I'll solve all your problems.

00:32:58.680 --> 00:32:59.520
Yun,

00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:01.030
how does your leg feel?

00:33:07.510 --> 00:33:08.350
It's... It's alright.

00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:13.520
What did I say?

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:14.750
You're young.

00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:17.240
You must have great recuperative powers.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.550
I'll be relieved, then.

00:33:33.790 --> 00:33:34.630
Shen,

00:33:35.790 --> 00:33:36.640
I'm back.

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:39.750
They...

00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:40.920
Are we having some guests?

00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:42.510
This is Lady Yu

00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:43.400
and her husband Yun.

00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:47.720
Don't worry.

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:48.560
They're not bad guys.

00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:52.720
Be seated.

00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:54.000
Sit, please.

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:05.270
Let me guess,

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:07.550
Shen brought you back, right?

00:34:11.150 --> 00:34:12.070
She's always a woman

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:13.630
beautiful and good-hearted.

00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:15.070
She can't bear the trouble.

00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:16.510
She always does her best

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:17.960
to help people in need.

00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:20.070
That's right.

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:22.190
You must be Mr. Cui.

00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:23.880
Ms. Shen just mentioned you.

00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:25.880
She was so helpful

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:26.720
that she saved us.

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:27.920
We're very grateful.

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:29.680
What are you talking about?

00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:31.350
You must be tired.

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:33.190
Today, you can rarely drink.

00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:34.400
Relax yourself.

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:35.240
Alright.

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:38.510
Why is the wine milk-white?

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:41.030
He brewed it himself.

00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:41.870
It's not strong wine.

00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:43.630
Lady Yu, can you drink?

00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:45.280
Would you like some?

00:34:49.710 --> 00:34:50.760
Yun is injured.

00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:52.390
He won't drink, and neither will I.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.070
But when the two of us

00:34:54.070 --> 00:34:55.280
were in Qingzhou,

00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:57.400
we heard the milk wine

00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:58.880
was unique in North Qi.

00:34:59.190 --> 00:35:00.110
I didn't know

00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:01.360
Mr. Cui could also brew it.

00:35:04.430 --> 00:35:05.280
I only know a little.

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:07.550
He isn't good
at literature or martial arts.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.550
Luckily, he's good with his hands.

00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:11.960
He tasted it when he was at the border.

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:13.710
So, he secretly brewed some

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:14.760
to satisfy himself.

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:17.320
He doesn't usually drink much.

00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:18.160
That's right.

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:19.240
Oh, I see.

00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:21.110
Like you said,

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:22.280
the two of you

00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:23.960
are from Qingzhou, right?

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:27.320
Did a war start there again?

00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:29.350
No.

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:32.070
We just got married.

00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:34.150
So, we planned to rely on relatives

00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:34.990
in Huajing City

00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:36.320
and do a small business.

00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:41.000
So, you just got married.

00:35:41.770 --> 00:35:42.630
Come on.

00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:44.070
I wouldn't know before you confessed.

00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:49.840
Did I say something wrong?

00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:56.200
She's a bit shy.

00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:58.510
She isn't too close to me in public.

00:35:59.670 --> 00:36:01.000
So, between us,

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:02.760
I'm the outgoing one.

00:36:03.550 --> 00:36:04.550
Sorry for that.

00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:14.870
Don't say that.

00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:16.030
Let's eat.

00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:17.030
- Eat.
- Come on.

00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:17.870
Let's start to eat.

00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:19.160
Come on.

00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:20.840
Here, Lady Yu.

00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:22.870
Here, Shen. Have some meat.

00:36:55.150 --> 00:36:55.990
Yu.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.360
No need to pretend in here.

00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:11.910
What's on your mind?

00:37:24.110 --> 00:37:24.960
I'm thinking

00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:27.670
this room is too small.

00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:29.440
There's only one bed and one quilt.

00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:30.550
Tonight,

00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:32.280
how are we supposed to sleep?

00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:39.150
You're right.

00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:42.110
I didn't notice it.

00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:51.440
I'll go ask Ms. Shen

00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:53.280
if there's another room.

00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:58.400
What kind of newlywed couple

00:37:58.400 --> 00:37:59.360
would sleep separately?

00:38:02.590 --> 00:38:03.430
Besides,

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:05.110
you heard them

00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:06.590
over dinner.

00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:09.760
Mr. Cui

00:38:10.070 --> 00:38:12.070
could brew North Qi's wine milk.

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:13.880
So, he's very likely

00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:14.720
to be from North Qi.

00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:16.920
Ms. Shen saved us.

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:18.280
But Mr. Cui

00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:19.590
clearly doesn't believe

00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:20.480
our identities.

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:22.880
It's better to be safe than sorry.

00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:24.630
We should be careful.

00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:28.510
I'll get an extra quilt.

00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:30.320
I'll take the floor.

00:38:31.070 --> 00:38:31.910
No.

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:33.280
The floor's too damp.

00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:34.280
And you're injured.

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:36.150
You can't be sleeping there.

00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:38.110
Also, the floor is dirty.

00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:39.590
If we use the quilt on it,

00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:42.320
they might figure out our secret

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:43.510
when they see it tomorrow.

00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:52.510
It's fine.

00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:53.710
Just one night.

00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:56.280
Tomorrow, we'll get up and leave.

00:38:57.030 --> 00:38:57.960
You're injured.

00:38:57.960 --> 00:38:58.800
You'll use the quilt.

Had a nightmare?

00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:56.920
Why are you still awake?

00:41:00.110 --> 00:41:00.950
