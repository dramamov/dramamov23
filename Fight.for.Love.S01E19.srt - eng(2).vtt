You're right.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.560
It gets cold at night.

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:59.790
I'll go get a quilt.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.150
Why are you still up?

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.990
I can't fall asleep

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.200
until you do.

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:12.310
What's on your mind?

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:17.750
I'm wondering

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.680
whether Mr. Song and his brother

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:22.800
have escorted Gu Chusheng

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.240
back to Huajing City?

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.000
Do you care so much about him?

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.240
Or is it that you

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.870
don't trust Song Wenchang

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:31.710
and Song Shilan?

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.080
I trust them.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:36.430
It's just that...

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.030
Gu Chusheng is carrying

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.150
such critical information.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.360
That's why I...

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:48.680
Why did you ask that?

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:51.800
I was just curious.

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.870
Curious?

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:54.750
How curious?

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:57.590
A little bit.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.190
Just a little bit?

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.470
Fine. I won't tell you.

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.000
Come on, tell me.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:14.680
Alright, then.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:19.920
Actually, it's nothing much.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.600
I remember

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.600
I was about 14 at that time.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.430
He helped me out.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.120
Back then, I thought

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:30.780
I had met a man

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:31.800
who truly loved me.

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.920
But later...

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.080
I don't blame him.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.220
After all, he wasn't obligated

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.800
to return my feelings.

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.160
When I returned to Huajing City,

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.040
that was the first time I had lived

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:51.680
with my mother and my sister.

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:53.600
At that time, Mother only cared

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.270
about my sister.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:56.760
So,

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.240
I did all sorts of things

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.560
to get Mother's attention.

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.680
It's just like how Jin tries

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:03.830
to get Linyang's attention.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.600
Sadly, nothing went as planned.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.440
I wanted

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:10.800
to find someone

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:11.920
who would care about me.

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:15.270
Human hearts

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:16.310
are flawed.

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.190
But one can't dwell

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:19.430
on those flaws forever.

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:22.830
So, now,

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:25.600
do you still like Gu Chusheng?

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.360
Of course not.

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:35.830
Whenever

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.310
I like someone,

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:38.750
I'll do my best to care for him.

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:40.310
But once I stop liking him,

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.000
I won't look back.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:48.760
What about me?

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:57.400
You?

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.070
I remember when I first met you,

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:13.240
you were

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:14.680
about 16 years old.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.750
Yeah. Back then,

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.040
you and your father

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.560
returned in triumph.

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:21.430
I happened to see that.

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:24.630
When I had my first battle,

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:25.510
I was 17 years old.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.560
Are you sure?

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.270
So, you were 17.

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:36.800
It's been so many years.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.500
It's normal I got it wrong.

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.160
Never mind. I remember

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:42.800
everyone in Huajing City

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.190
came out to welcome you.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.390
The streets were packed.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.560
I happened to be in a private room

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:49.400
at a tea house.

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:50.750
I looked down

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:52.560
and saw you and your family

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:53.920
leading your troops

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.920
into the city.

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:57.230
Room?

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:58.950
From which tea house room

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:00.000
can you see the city gate?

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.080
Spring Breeze House.

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:07.720
That's the one.

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:08.720
You didn't know?

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:10.510
One must pass that tea house

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:12.720
before entering Huajing City.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:14.560
I remember

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:15.720
all the young ladies

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:16.920
in that tea house

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:17.760
were chattering away.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.750
They said Young Master Wei Yun
was very impressive.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.120
I looked out of the window

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.510
and spotted you at a glance.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.680
The way you rode a horse

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.080
looked amazing.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.920
Did you really spot me at a glance?

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.070
Yes, I did.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.800
You looked great on the horse.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.430
You're really the young man in white

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:40.240
who "pacified the North with a spear".

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.680
Truly extraordinary.

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:45.270
That's not right.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.040
Only when I defeated

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:48.510
North Qi invaders when I was 18

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.190
did people say that about me.

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:53.750
You must have made up the story

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:56.310
just to make me happy.

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:16.150
Give me your hand.

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:31.240
Good boy.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.790
Are you changing the subject?

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:49.790
Years ago, I did see you.

00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.480
But at that time,

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:02.390
I was too blind

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.000
to see how outstanding you were.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.840
If I were given a second chance,

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:10.150
I would take a good look at you.

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:13.840
So, now,

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:16.270
and in the future,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.670
will you take a good look at me?

00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:58.270
Not now.

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:01.200
I'm sleepy.

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:02.600
I'm too sleepy to see clearly.

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:04.830
My mind is too foggy to see.

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:06.240
My eyes are getting blurry.

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:20.790
Who are these people?

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:22.380
- What's going on?
- How did you get in?

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:23.390
Come out!

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:26.680
Hide.

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:28.150
North Qi soldiers broke in.

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:29.600
They're after us.

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:31.870
But if we hide,

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:32.710
you'll be in trouble.

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:33.750
Don't worry now.

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:35.240
Our priority is to keep you alive.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.150
Why helping us

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:37.080
when you suspect us?

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:38.670
Because Shen helped me

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:39.720
in the same way.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:40.870
Say no more. Come.

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:41.950
Come on. Hurry.

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:43.940
Be careful with your leg.

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:47.440
Hurry up.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.360
Commander, it was searched.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:59.200
No trace.

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:00.350
Commander,

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.000
we've searched all the other houses.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:02.870
Haven't found them.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:03.960
This is the last one.

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:08.710
Search it.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.360
What a surprise.

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:25.040
I didn't find new friends here,

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:26.790
but I met an old one.

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:29.630
Cui Yi.

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:32.190
If I remember correctly,

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.120
I gave you this code name.

00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:37.390
Commander Shen,

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.120
did you come here

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:41.390
to bring me back to North Qi?

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:43.510
In that case, punish me as you wish.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.840
But I'm begging you.

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:47.720
Please spare the villagers.

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:51.960
You're a mere runaway spy.

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.200
I don't need to capture you

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.080
in such a grand manner.

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:00.870
Who are you hiding

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:01.720
in your house?

00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:09.600
You know what I can do.

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:11.040
Get out of my way.

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:17.600
Commander Shen!

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:20.230
Commander!

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:28.750
A local woman?

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:31.470
Cui.

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:32.920
Shen.

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:34.230
Cui Yi,

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:36.910
does she know who you are?

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:38.960
Commander Shen,

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:39.870
she doesn't.

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:41.120
She doesn't know anything.

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:42.680
Tomorrow,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.440
I will marry her

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:46.720
and live incognito

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:47.840
in this village.

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:50.360
We didn't tell anyone

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:52.200
about any of it.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.040
It doesn't matter.

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:55.360
Even if she didn't know anything,

00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:57.320
she will know from now on.

00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:59.600
As a spy from North Qi,

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:02.360
you first fled from the battlefield,

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:03.630
and then you got exposed.

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:04.870
This is a capital offense.

00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:08.120
I could've killed you

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.360
right here and now.

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:11.240
But in light

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:12.390
of your past contributions,

00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:14.120
I can give you a chance

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:15.120
to live.

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:23.240
Do you still remember

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:25.420
how to use this flare signal?

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:28.400
If you find any trace of these two,

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:31.080
light it to notify me.

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:33.720
Why don't you kill me?

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:38.630
Kill you?

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:40.720
A man like you

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:42.550
loves a woman from Great Sui.

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:44.440
You must be struggling

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:45.600
in agony.

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:47.600
Now, she knows

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:48.440
who you really are.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.120
Every look

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:51.120
she gives you

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:53.000
will be killing you.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.630
So, I don't need to kill you myself.

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:30.270
I've known Cui for years.

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:32.320
How could he be from North Qi?

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:34.000
Yeah.

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.120
Could it be a mistake?

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:36.030
But that commander

00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:36.910
didn't kill him.

00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:39.080
He said Mr. Cui was a spy

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:39.960
from North Qi.

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:40.840
What do we do?

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:41.720
Will he get us

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:42.560
into trouble?

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.240
It's hard to say. Earlier,

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:45.270
why wasn't he taken away?

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:47.030
What do you think?

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:48.320
If he's really from North Qi,

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:49.160
what do we do?

00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:50.030
He isn't!

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:51.670
I don't care which country

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:52.990
he is from.

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:55.600
I just know he's the best man!

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:57.320
Everyone,

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:00.360
those people were looking for us.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.040
Mr. Cui

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:03.480
wanted to help us,

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.560
- so...
- Lady Yu.

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:08.160
Don't say that.

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:10.320
Back then,

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:12.200
Shen saved me like this.

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:13.960
That's why

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:16.000
I was so determined to help you.

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:19.920
But...

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:21.480
I didn't know

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:23.630
I would get the villagers

00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:24.910
into such big trouble.

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:27.200
You're right.

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:28.750
I'm from North Qi.

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:30.000
See? I was right.

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:31.080
So, he really is.

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:35.280
Shen,

00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:38.510
I knew this day

00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:40.750
would come eventually.

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:42.590
We'll be in trouble.

00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:45.870
Everyone,

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:47.390
when day breaks,

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:49.270
I will leave this village

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:51.030
together with them.

00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:55.500
- It's easy for him.
- They can just leave.

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:56.360
But what about us

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:58.030
who will have to stay?

00:15:58.360 --> 00:15:59.360
Don't be so heartless.

00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:00.630
Don't leave me behind.

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:03.150
I'll go with you.

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:15.560
What's he doing?

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:21.080
I'm begging you

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:23.080
not to give Shen a hard time

00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:25.080
for the sake of our past.

00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:32.110
Actually, Mr. Cui

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:33.960
used to help us a lot.

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:35.080
Yeah.

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:36.480
He's from North Qi,

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:38.360
but he hasn't hurt anyone.

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:46.600
I beg all of you.

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:48.320
Please don't push us.

00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:49.630
What should we do?

00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:54.200
Where can you escape to?

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:55.840
You have a broken leg

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.200
and you're injured.

00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:58.320
Even if you run away,

00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:00.200
you'll still be caught.

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:02.600
I don't care where Mr. Cui is from.

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:03.600
I just know

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:04.960
he helped me tend my livestock

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:05.960
for free.

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:07.000
I once fell off a mountain.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:08.480
If he hadn't treated me in time,

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:09.750
I would have died!

00:17:10.110 --> 00:17:11.550
Mr. Cui is the kindest man

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:12.590
I've ever met!

00:17:12.590 --> 00:17:13.430
Yeah.

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:15.720
When I was hunting in the mountains,

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:17.480
I ran into some bandits.

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:19.680
If Mr. Cui hadn't saved me,

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:22.480
I would have fallen into their hands.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:23.840
That's right.

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:24.960
Mr. Cui is a great man.

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:25.800
Young man,

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:27.560
don't be scared.

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:30.750
We wouldn't believe

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.960
what those villains say.

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:35.790
We certainly know

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:37.270
you're a good man

00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:39.440
and you've been helpful.

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:40.750
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:42.790
During a war,

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.510
common people like us suffer the most.

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:45.830
You're from North Qi,

00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:48.270
but you are just like us

00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:49.240
who suffer from war.

00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:50.870
Stay here.

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:51.960
In this village,

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:53.240
you will be protected.

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:54.550
Yeah. Stay with us.

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:56.350
- Stay.
- Stay.

00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:57.310
Stay with us.

00:17:57.550 --> 00:17:58.400
Don't leave.

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:00.160
- Stay.
- Stay.

00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:03.350
- Stay.
- Stay.

00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:05.440
- Stay.
- Stay.

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:08.790
We will protect you.

00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:11.390
Everybody.

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:14.110
Let me be frank.

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:16.160
I'm Marquis Wei Yun,

00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:18.030
son of Wei Zhong.

00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:21.070
(Wei)
The marquis?

00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:22.830
- The Wei's token?
- This is my proof.

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:26.200
Is this real?

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:30.720
This is Chu Yu,
daughter of Chu Jianchang.

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:33.350
We were fighting rebels

00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:34.240
at Dingfeng Valley.

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:35.550
We fled all the way here.

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:37.480
We didn't mean to be incognito.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.270
We will handle this.

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:41.510
If you trust us,

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.440
we will keep you safe.

00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:51.590
Indeed.

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:52.560
This is real.

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:54.590
This is the Wei's token.

00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:55.590
Really?

00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:56.830
Mr. Zheng has identified it.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:57.960
It must be real.

00:18:58.200 --> 00:18:59.590
Are you really Mr. Wei,

00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:01.000
Marquis of Zhenguo?

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:04.240
I'm Zheng Zhi,
centurion of the 13th Battalion

00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:06.030
of the Wei Army.

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:08.640
I didn't expect to see you

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:10.550
after all these years.

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:12.280
Your Lordship,

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:14.400
I must kneel.

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:15.830
Gentleman,

00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:17.160
please get up.

00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:18.960
In terms of seniority,

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:21.160
you are my elder.

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:23.390
I should

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:25.550
bow to you.

00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:27.630
Alright.

00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:30.390
Everyone,

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:32.720
please trust us.

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:34.680
As long as we are here,

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:36.000
you will be safe,

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:37.550
no matter what happens.

00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:38.960
That's wonderful.

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:39.920
Wonderful, indeed.

00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:40.910
Yeah.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:42.960
Yeah.

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:45.200
- We'll be safe.
- Yeah. Great.

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:47.370
- Great.
- We'll be safe.

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.080
Wonderful.

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:50.510
This is perfect.

00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:54.270
We will be safe.

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:07.760
Mr. Cui,

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:08.840
deliver this letter

00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:10.270
to my brother Chu Linyang.

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:11.320
When he receives it,

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:12.920
he will give us a hand.

00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:15.150
Alright.

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:16.520
Are you confident

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:17.760
to dodge Shen You?

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:20.040
Don't worry.

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:22.000
They want you.

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:23.270
As long as I tell him

00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:24.110
you're in our village

00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:25.960
and will attend our wedding,

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:27.200
he will come.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:28.920
I'm asking

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:31.030
if you're confident to be safe.

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:39.720
You must protect yourself.

00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:43.110
Don't worry.

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:44.440
I believe

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:45.550
they still need me,

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:46.750
so they won't hurt me.

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:48.400
When I give the signal

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:49.270
tomorrow,

00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:50.440
you must get ready.

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:02.160
The villagers have been evacuated.

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:03.960
What worries you now?

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:07.270
I think you and I

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:08.720
have the same worries.

00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:13.830
The people in this village

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:16.070
reminded me of my life

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:17.400
with Father and Linyang

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:18.240
in Fengling City.

00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:20.440
That's a border town.

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:22.270
Because of the war, people there

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:24.030
suffered everything

00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:26.070
just like people in this village.

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:29.990
A single raindrop seems small,

00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:31.640
but for the people it falls on,

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:34.160
it can feel like a flood.

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:39.000
In times of war,

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:41.440
the common people suffer most.

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:45.920
My family has long defended

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:48.440
the peace and stability of Great Sui.

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:50.720
I believe that one day,

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:52.640
all the sufferings will end.

00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:56.880
By then, I'll give you a life

00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:58.680
where you can enjoy nature

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:04.310
and have Xiaoqi by your side.

00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:32.270
Mr. Cui told Shen You

00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:33.110
of our presence.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.550
General Chu will arrive soon.

00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:38.200
Are you nervous

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:40.280
about the wedding?

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:45.840
Why would I?

00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:47.200
It's not a real wedding.

00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:58.590
But to me, it's real.

00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:03.730
(Joy)

00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:04.590
Put it higher.

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:06.590
A bit to the right.

00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:07.650
Put it here.

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:09.040
Such a joyous day.

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:10.080
That's right.

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:12.300
(Joy)

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:19.510
I'll be right there.

00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:28.110
Be careful.

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:30.790
Here comes the bride.

00:23:31.030 --> 00:23:32.000
She's coming out.

00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:36.750
- Lovely.
- Wonderful.

00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:37.870
Be careful.

00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:39.160
Lovely.

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:40.000
Really lovely.

00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:45.910
Here we are.

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:50.790
Where's the groom?

00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:54.550
He shouldn't

00:23:54.550 --> 00:23:56.200
keep the bride waiting.

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:57.400
- Right.
- Yeah.

00:23:58.030 --> 00:23:59.000
If he doesn't come out,

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.310
young men like us...

00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:02.030
Young men like them

00:24:02.030 --> 00:24:03.550
will steal the bride away.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.880
Here comes the groom.

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:11.720
Here he is.

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:13.000
Where is he?

00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:15.960
The groom is here.

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:17.790
Handsome.

00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:19.670
He looks really charming.

00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:23.420
Hooray.

00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:24.680
My Lady, here he is.

00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:27.270
- So handsome.
- That's right.

00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:28.200
He looks so handsome.

00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:30.350
- Handsome.
- Lovely.

00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:31.190
Hooray.

00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:01.790
The groom's getting shy.

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:06.920
It's time.

00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:09.350
Here we go.

00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:13.960
Hooray!

00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:15.430
Be careful.

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:18.510
- Yeah.
- Lovely.

00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:21.080
Hooray.

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:28.350
Don't be scared.

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:30.270
Grain pieces are being scattered.

00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:41.960
The scattered pieces

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:44.110
indicate plenty of food.

00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:46.550
Step over the high saddle,

00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:49.000
and you'll always be safe.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.240
May the groom

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:54.030
always love his wife.

00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:57.200
Buddies,

00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:58.550
hit the groom!

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:00.510
Let's hit the groom.

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:01.520
Don't hit him.

00:26:03.610 --> 00:26:04.510
Bride,

00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:05.950
this is our tradition.

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:06.830
If we don't hit him,

00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:08.590
he won't care for you.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:09.840
You must not hit him.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:13.400
Don't defend him like that.

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:16.720
You're truly impartial.

00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:17.910
Just don't hit him.

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:27.520
Linyang,

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:29.760
proceed.

00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:42.240
Bow to each other.

00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:50.630
The ceremony is done.

00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:51.710
Bridal chamber is the next.

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:53.520
Yu,

00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:55.790
I swear to you.

00:26:56.790 --> 00:26:58.270
I will be your husband

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:00.000
and love you always.

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:02.800
Do you accept this?

00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:27.270
You once gave me a flower

00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:28.110
that made me happy.

00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:30.750
Today, I give you this garland.

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:32.830
I hope you will

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:34.920
always be happy and safe

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:36.550
from this day forward.

00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:39.130
♪Through countless turns♪

00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:43.330
♪And all we've borne,
no regret ever could be sworn♪

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:44.800
Yu,

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:47.040
on this very day...

00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:51.070
Give me a chance.

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:54.080
Will you?

00:27:54.390 --> 00:27:58.710
♪We've reached
this blossom-covered hill♪

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:04.950
♪I'll follow you through every dream♪

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:29.280
Wei Yun?

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:44.440
So, this wedding

00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:47.000
is a trap for me.

00:28:47.270 --> 00:28:48.110
That's right.

00:28:48.550 --> 00:28:50.400
What do you think, Shen?

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:51.520
Do you like it?

00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:54.680
We've been waiting for some time.

00:28:55.030 --> 00:28:56.030
North Qi villains,

00:28:56.350 --> 00:28:57.190
you can't escape

00:28:57.960 --> 00:28:59.510
this time.

00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:07.030
You think you can catch me?

00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:24.150
I'll kill you!

00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:25.830
How dare you bully us?

00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:26.880
I'll kill you!

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:29.720
I'll kill you! I just will!

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:30.560
Why are you back?

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:32.270
These villains

00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:33.310
are our sworn enemies!

00:29:33.790 --> 00:29:34.630
Cui Yi,

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:35.790
you betrayed me!

00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:37.680
I did not betray you!

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:39.680
In this village,

00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:40.720
they treat me

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:41.590
as one of their own.

00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:43.030
Fight them!

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:26.040
Wei Qiu.

00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:28.350
Yes.

00:30:58.440 --> 00:30:59.280
Linyang.

00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:10.390
I...

00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:18.590
Here, Yu.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:19.840
Thank you, Linyang.

00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:21.150
Thanks.

00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:25.400
Ms. Shen.

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:26.240
You...

00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:28.590
Here you are.

00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:30.080
No need.

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:32.210
This isn't a thank-you gift.

00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:33.150
It's a wedding gift.

00:31:33.670 --> 00:31:35.070
For you and Mr. Cui.

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:38.160
Thank you, Lady Yu.

00:31:38.510 --> 00:31:40.270
Don't say that.

00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:41.750
What a shame.

00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:42.960
Shen You ran away.

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:44.250
He's too cunning.

00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:45.310
I let him escape.

00:31:46.510 --> 00:31:48.510
A spy from North Qi will kill himself

00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:49.920
when he's captured alive.

00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:51.400
Even if we caught him,

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:52.530
we wouldn't get

00:31:52.530 --> 00:31:53.480
what we needed.

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:55.310
So, I let him run away

00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:56.560
and had Wei Qiu stalk him.

00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:58.550
We'll see if we can

00:31:58.550 --> 00:31:59.440
uncover his mastermind.

00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:03.350
However...

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:09.000
This village is no longer safe.

00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:10.400
But don't worry.

00:32:10.550 --> 00:32:11.640
My troops will escort you

00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:13.110
to somewhere absolutely safe.

00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:15.750
Sorry, but you have to

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:18.310
start a new life.

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:20.760
It's alright.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.510
Don't worry, Your Lordship.

00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:24.240
When we're with the villagers,

00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:25.520
wherever we are,

00:32:25.790 --> 00:32:26.790
we'll still have a home.

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:29.320
Your Lordship,

00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:33.270
are the two of you really not a couple?

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:34.720
Yu,

00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:37.030
I didn't say

00:32:37.030 --> 00:32:37.920
"Bow to each other".

00:32:38.550 --> 00:32:39.680
Why did you remind me?

00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:49.750
We should act till the very end.

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:51.310
Then it would be more convincing.

00:32:52.410 --> 00:32:53.270
But at that moment,

00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:54.240
only our own men

00:32:54.510 --> 00:32:55.590
were in the wedding yard.

00:32:56.030 --> 00:32:56.920
Even if you had missed,

00:32:57.770 --> 00:32:59.030
no one would have exposed you.

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:02.550
Be honest with me.

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:03.800
Now,

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:05.960
are you in love with someone?

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:26.280
Wanyue,

00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:27.960
have the two of them

00:33:28.270 --> 00:33:29.310
always acted like that?

00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:31.920
They didn't act like that before.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.550
But this time, His Lordship

00:33:37.550 --> 00:33:38.640
was injured

00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:40.480
and Her Ladyship was soft-hearted.

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:42.830
He...

00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:44.750
Did he take advantage of that?

00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:48.830
Are they eloping?

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:51.350
What are you talking about?

00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:52.920
How annoying.

00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:15.670
Wei Yun, look.

00:34:18.150 --> 00:34:19.550
So many fireflies.

00:34:29.710 --> 00:34:30.550
Chu Yu.

00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:33.630
My promise in the cave

00:34:34.630 --> 00:34:35.670
will always count.

00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:38.760
Right now,

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:40.880
I swear to the world.

00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:43.360
I wish

00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:45.030
to take Chu Yu as my wife.

00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:47.880
Will you give me your answer now?

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:53.000
♪Who can break free

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.080
♪There's no other way♪

00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:57.120
Earlier today,

00:34:58.110 --> 00:34:59.920
you asked me at the wedding.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:02.920
Why did you ask again?

00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:08.400
Just now, Yun asked Yu.

00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:11.010
Now, Wei Yun is asking Chu Yu.

00:35:11.010 --> 00:35:15.640
♪What bothers me gradually ripples♪

00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:22.400
♪Why does it feel

00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:26.970
♪Until time sees through us♪

Be with me.

00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:33.940
♪I keep all my feelings♪

00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:36.000
I'll handle the gossip.

00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:38.400
I'll solve all those problems.

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:41.550
I will heal everything

00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:44.110
that has hurt you.

00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:45.600
Whatever you lost,

00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:48.440
whatever you failed to get,

00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:50.630
and whatever you want...

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:53.840
I'll give it all.

00:35:58.190 --> 00:36:00.070
You also have feelings for me, right?

00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:01.880
Otherwise,

00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:03.960
why didn't you refuse me

00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:07.440
when I took you out?

00:36:32.110 --> 00:36:33.670
If my feelings for you

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:37.630
bring you so much sorrow,

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:39.710
then you can forget

00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:43.630
what I just said.

00:36:48.110 --> 00:36:49.030
I'm afraid

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.480
I have become

00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:53.400
a heartless person.

00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:04.000
I'm afraid I will hurt

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:05.480
your passionate feelings.

00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:07.400
You aren't heartless.

00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:09.110
I'm more determined

00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:11.550
to like you than anyone else.

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:18.590
So, please don't shrink back.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:29.840
I accept you.

00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:32.630
But only for now.

00:37:37.070 --> 00:37:38.000
Look around.

00:37:39.070 --> 00:37:40.550
So many fireflies.

00:37:41.710 --> 00:37:43.030
Feels so unreal.

00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:46.190
As if they existed only for tonight.

00:37:47.550 --> 00:37:49.110
Just like the two of us.

00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:53.710
What price

00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:57.670
do we have to pay for this love?

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:04.720
I don't want to pay.

00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:09.640
Since the day

00:38:10.090 --> 00:38:11.710
I decided to "marry" your brother,

00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:14.830
we were never meant to be together.

00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:20.550
You're a very, very good man.

00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:26.760
You'll find the woman

00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:29.190
who is right for you.

00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:33.400
But it shouldn't be me.

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:43.160
Wei Yun,

00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:46.590
we should go back to Huajing City.

00:39:18.070 --> 00:39:18.910
Chu Yu,

00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:22.000
I won't give up.

00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:34.700
(Huajing City)

00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:57.640
They're back.

00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:59.110
They really are.

00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:07.010
Yun!

00:40:07.110 --> 00:40:08.190
Mrs. Wei!

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:16.880
Get out of the way.

00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:18.500
Your Lordship.

00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:19.350
Good.

00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:20.240
Very good.

00:40:28.110 --> 00:40:29.030
Yu.

00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:30.480
Yun. Wanyue.

00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:31.320
Is everybody alright?

00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:32.960
Yes, yes.

00:40:34.190 --> 00:40:36.440
Time has gone by.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:40.920
Young people have grown outstanding.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.230
There will always be those

00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:45.510
to carry on the spirit of our nation.

00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:49.400
Wei Zhong.

00:40:50.070 --> 00:40:51.030
Jianchang.

00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:53.150
The two of you

00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:55.320
may rest in peace now.

00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:56.510
Were you injured?

00:40:57.190 --> 00:40:59.150
Just a little bit.

00:40:59.150 --> 00:41:00.070
I'm fine now.

00:41:01.110 --> 00:41:02.360
What did the two of you do

00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:03.400
after you eloped?

00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:06.920
Glad you're all right.

00:41:07.250 --> 00:41:08.560
- So sad.
- I'm fine.

00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:11.710
- Someone will be upset again.
- Go home. I'll make you nice food.

00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:28.640
Yu.

00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:32.200
Let's go.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:45.920
Wait for me.

00:41:53.550 --> 00:41:54.390
What's going on here?

00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:56.330
How dare you

00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:58.080
even interrogate me?

00:41:58.630 --> 00:41:59.960
Her Highness was assassinated.

00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:01.320
Shouldn't you investigate

00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:02.280
those people around her?

00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:04.510
I'm just asking, Father.

00:42:05.230 --> 00:42:06.400
No interrogation at all.

00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:11.920
The Wei and Chu families
have been cleared.

00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:13.230
How can you still laugh?

00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:17.230
From this day on,

00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:18.510
civil officials like us

00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:19.550
will have no place.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:20.840
Father,

00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:23.550
do you know

00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:26.630
the Crown Prince is heading
for Wei Yun's mansion?

00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:42.670
I'm here to apologize.

00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:45.920
In Baidi Valley,

00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:47.880
I was so muddle-headed

00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:49.510
that Yao Yong deceived me.

00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:51.710
And I've been too cowardly

00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:54.070
to face reality.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:56.510
After my aunt was assassinated,

00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:00.070
my father fell sick from grief.

00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:02.440
Then, I suddenly understood.

00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:03.840
In this world,

00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:05.360
no one will wait for me to be mature.

00:43:08.550 --> 00:43:09.390
Your Highness,

00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:10.840
whoever it is,

00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:12.760
when he has protectors,

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.030
he will always believe

00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:15.480
he's the most powerful person.

00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:17.840
He may be arrogant

00:43:18.070 --> 00:43:19.320
and unaware of true hardship.

00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:21.190
He may mistakenly believe

00:43:21.550 --> 00:43:22.800
he can conquer everything.

00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:24.630
Little does he know

00:43:25.110 --> 00:43:26.070
some people have

00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:27.550
cleared the way ahead of us,

00:43:28.070 --> 00:43:29.630
leaving only minor troubles

00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:30.480
for us to solve.

00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:32.630
Just to feed our pride.

00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:36.840
I was once like that.

00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:38.240
So was Wen Yun.

00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:45.590
I pleaded for you.

00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:50.030
Regarding Yao Yong's case,

00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:52.590
this is His Majesty's decree.

00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:58.110
I'm still confused about one thing.

00:43:59.070 --> 00:44:00.320
I seek your guidance, Father.

00:44:02.670 --> 00:44:04.190
Recently, I've been working

00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:05.510
on the assassination case.

00:44:07.070 --> 00:44:08.550
Very few people knew

00:44:08.550 --> 00:44:09.480
where I was that day.

00:44:10.190 --> 00:44:11.920
So, I wonder how the assassin

00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:14.440
found me at such a remote place.

00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:18.510
Don't you know

00:44:18.510 --> 00:44:19.960
how many enemies you've made?

00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:21.960
How dare you question me

00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:22.800
over this trifle?

00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:24.590
Gu Chusheng,

00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:26.550
you are merely

00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:27.710
the Minister of Justice.

00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:29.110
I made a contribution

00:44:30.550 --> 00:44:32.230
and I will soon be promoted

00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:33.360
to Minister of Personnel.

00:44:37.770 --> 00:44:40.400
Thank you, Father,
for your past support.

00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:44.320
Who gave you a better offer?

00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:52.920
The court needs talented officials now.

00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:55.190
Why don't you believe

00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:57.960
that I earned this promotion on my own?
