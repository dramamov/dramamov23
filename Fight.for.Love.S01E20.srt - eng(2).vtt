(Thrive and Prosper)

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:53.630
Shilan,

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:55.830
we've been practicing like this

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:56.600
for four hours now.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.510
Why won't Father let us in?

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:59.350
Do you think

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.120
he's not even inside?

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.560
Wenchang, if you speak louder,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.230
Father can still hear you

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:07.480
even if he isn't at home.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:14.680
Stand up.

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.360
You seem to have a strong voice.

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.750
You truly look

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.150
like battle-hardened soldiers.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.960
You flatter us.

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.030
You're more vigorous than us.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.280
I've heard that when you

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.400
went to suppress Yao's troops,

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.800
you fought three against one.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.640
How invincible.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.150
As your son, I'm impressed.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.520
I've also heard you're good.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:40.710
However,

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.960
you just learned a few moves.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.030
How could you be so overconfident

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.870
and fool around

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.470
with Wei Yun?

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:49.630
I was helping Yun

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:50.590
eliminate villains.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:51.870
We were not fooling around.

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:53.560
Besides,

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.400
I captured

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.360
at least

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.680
15 rebels.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.760
You used to accuse me of fooling around,

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.150
but I've achieved

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.120
great merit this time.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.080
Yet you're still angry.

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.350
You're so hard to please.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.060
After standing in a horse stance
for four hours,

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.440
you still haven't realized why.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.120
Forget it.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.960
No more horse stance.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.030
Starting today,

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.120
practice calligraphy

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.470
for 15 pages every day.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:16.840
Hand them to me.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.190
I'll check them personally.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:19.910
If you miss one,

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.480
you'll be punished with three more

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.150
until you understand.

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:25.430
Father.

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.630
Wenchang and I acted impulsively,

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.080
risking our lives

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.400
by going to Dingfeng Valley.

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:31.750
Sorry for worrying you.

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:33.430
Father, rest assured.

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:35.430
Wenchang and I will deliver

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:36.990
our calligraphy work every day

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.880
to your desk on time.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.030
Did I say you should also do that?

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.870
Listen.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.590
You must swing your sword
1,000 times a day,

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:47.870
shoot 300 arrows,

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.790
and stand in a horse stance
for two hours.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.080
Can you do that?

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:55.400
I accept my punishment.

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:57.520
Father,

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.870
this is so unfair.

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.710
I was the one

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:01.570
who encouraged Shilan.

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.240
The punishment should be the same.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:05.800
Shilan,

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:07.590
do you also think

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:09.750
I'm unfair?

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.520
No.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:15.800
Wenchang will inherit

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:16.830
your title.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.120
He mustn't take risks.

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.160
I failed to stop Wenchang.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.680
It's my fault.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:24.600
I was wrong.

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:29.150
Shilan,

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.260
I think you're most like me

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.000
when I was young.

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:36.830
You know how to be ambitious

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.870
and also how to protect yourself.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.000
I once thought

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.750
that if you were Wenchang,

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.240
our family

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.680
might be in a different situation.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:50.520
Father,

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.950
how can you say that?

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.390
Am I not good enough?

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:56.230
I understand.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.600
Wenchang may be playful,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.240
but he has a pure heart.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.360
You chose to step back

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:03.510
to avoid the whirlpool

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:04.800
of the court.

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:06.830
Wenchang is more suited

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.560
to the future duke than I am.

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:11.270
So,

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:12.560
you didn't join the army

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.430
but took the imperial exams and went

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.070
to the Court of Judicial Review.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.120
Shilan,

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.430
my intentions

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:24.310
are clear to you,

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.670
but I also know

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:27.980
you have military talent.

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:29.190
Not being in the army

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.680
is a waste of your abilities.

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:36.430
As part of the family,

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:38.320
I understand

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:39.560
that our family's honor

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.000
and losses are shared.

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:45.430
Let me think about it.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.280
I'll try to figure it out.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.520
Father,

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:49.800
please also reconsider

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:50.830
my calligraphy work

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:52.010
and Shilan's exercise.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.560
I just want to teach you a lesson.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.020
Don't think

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:58.270
about getting away from this.

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:59.110
Go now.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.320
- Father.
- Go.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:02.320
Go!

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.430
I can protect you for a while,

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.240
but not forever.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:30.920
Lan said

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.000
that when Yao Yong rebelled,

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:34.240
the city was in chaos.

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:36.560
They rushed out
and forgot to lock the door.

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:38.390
When they came back,

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:40.480
Xiaoqi was gone.

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:42.750
These past few days,

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:44.800
Chun's been searching the city.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:45.640
But...

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.000
Maybe someone like me,

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:57.560
always on the go,

00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:59.050
isn't suited to take care of Xiaoqi.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:04.120
He's so adorable.

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:05.760
Maybe

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:07.720
he's found a new home.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:26.560
I should go home, too.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.040
Isn't this your home?

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:32.620
We can't force a firefly

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:34.160
to stop only

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.270
for ourselves.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.600
When we were in the small village,

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:41.510
we shared a beautiful dream.

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:43.830
Now that we're back in Huajing,

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:45.560
it's time to wake up.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:58.830
Yao Yong has been captured,

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:01.120
but the turmoil in Huajing City

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:01.960
has not yet ceased.

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:04.360
So, we still have

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.310
more important things to do next.

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:07.360
So, you have

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:09.720
even less reason to leave.

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.560
I can forgo the answer to that question

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.830
and even accept your refusal,

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.160
as long as you don't

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.000
avoid me.

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:28.470
No matter what,

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.240
we are still family.

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:32.120
How could I avoid you?

00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:34.630
My family's door

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:35.870
is always open for you.

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:38.990
My Lady,

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.270
I've packed everything

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:45.750
and checked it three times.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:46.900
Nothing is left behind.

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:57.920
Yun,

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:00.390
aren't you going to say goodbye?

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.140
There's no need for goodbye.

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:15.660
♪Snow falls silently, soft and light♪

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.240
You're just going home.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:20.850
♪Tinting strands of hair in white♪

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:21.710
Look.

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:23.270
The Marquis of Zhenguo

00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:24.480
is weaving a garland for you.

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:26.630
It's a custom here.

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:28.510
It seems

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.120
he truly likes you.

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:35.710
As the Marquis of Zhenguo,

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:37.030
he doesn't even frown

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:37.870
on the battlefield,

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.720
yet when weaving a garland...

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:47.160
♪With you, I ask the earth and sky♪

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:53.640
♪Our love, like ink, will never die♪

00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:18.270

♪Like a dream, yet so real♪

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:28.720
♪Like the eternal cycle of the seasons♪

♪Fulfilling our wishes together♪

♪Even if we turn to dust,

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:12.860
Welcome, please come in.

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:16.340
Hurry up.

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:19.460
Watch this.

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:21.550
My Lady,

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:23.200
you're still pregnant.

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:24.390
You shouldn't come

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:26.080
to this bustling market again.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:27.870
Chun has sent you to protect me,

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:28.840
hasn't she?

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.270
Someone is

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:31.440
always watching me

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:32.600
at home.

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:34.150
If this continues,

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:35.510
I'll suffocate.

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:39.060
Fresh steamed buns!

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:41.360
There seems to be a man.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.120
He's still alive.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:54.860
Don't...

00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:55.920
- It's okay.
- Don't go.

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.040
(Oh, no.)

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:03.630
(How could Ms. Wang be here?)

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:00.650
Fresh flowers!

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:18.600
The straight cut

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:19.440
on this man's leg

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:20.570
is almost to the bone,

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:22.200
so whoever did this

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:23.480
used a great deal of force.

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:28.310
Will such a severe injury

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:29.460
leave him disabled?

00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:30.990
It won't.

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:32.660
He's fortunate.

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.000
Though the blow was heavy,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.500
it didn't damage his tendons or bones.

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:37.320
He'll recover in a few days.

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:39.600
That's good to hear.

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:41.840
Thank you.

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:42.750
Goodbye.

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:43.800
Goodbye.

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:49.630
My Lady,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.440
we could leave it to officers.

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:53.550
Why trouble ourselves?

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:56.150
Since I've seen it,

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:57.720
I can't just ignore it.

00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:58.720
Leaving him here

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:01.360
can also accumulate blessings

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.750
for the child in my womb.

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:05.510
You always go all the way
in doing good deeds.

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:06.600
I'm afraid

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:07.910
that you'll promise

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:09.670
to take care of this man

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:11.360
for the rest of his life.

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:14.150
Though I'm willing to do good,

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:16.240
I can tell what's important.

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:43.510
Lisheng,

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:44.390
help him up.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.040
I'll fetch the physician.

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:46.990
Yes.

00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:52.120
I think I've seen him before.

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:53.200
Ma'am, here's your dish.

00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:54.630
- Thank you.
- Let me check.

00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:55.480
Wei Qiu.

00:14:59.120 --> 00:14:59.960
My Lady.

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.200
What are you doing here?

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:03.720
His Lordship said

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:06.150
that this inn has an excellent pastry

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:07.610
and asked me to buy some.

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:09.080
Did you just see

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:10.030
a physician walk out?

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:11.080
Bring him back for me.

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:18.200
My Lady,

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.140
why are you here alone?

00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:20.610
Why do you need a physician?

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.360
Are you feeling unwell?

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:24.360
Do you need me to escort you back?

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:26.360
Your barrage of questions

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:27.360
has left me unsure

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:28.420
which one to answer first.

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:30.600
Rest assured. I'm fine.

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:33.360
But a friend of mine is injured

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:34.630
and needs a physician.

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:37.680
That's good to hear.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.200
Huajing has just been in chaos,

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:40.720
and the city is not safe now.

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.200
Since you're in a delicate condition,

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:44.420
it's better to stay indoors

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:45.870
unless it's necessary.

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:01.960
Since you're awake,

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:03.080
stop pretending to be asleep.

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:05.590
It's not shameful for others to see you

00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:06.690
in a vulnerable state.

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:15.000
I've paid the physician's fee twice

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:15.870
to save you.

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:18.190
If I still fail,

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:22.160
that'd truly be embarrassing.

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:29.710
You must be thirsty.

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:30.800
Have some water.

00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:42.200
Why did you save me?

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:45.200
As the Marquis

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:47.930
of Zhenguo's family,

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:49.390
I can't watch others die.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:57.870
Could you pour me another cup?

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:15.350
Here.

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:20.720
Would you like to tell me

00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:22.510
why you were so severely injured?

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:28.880
I came from Qingzhou.

00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:30.630
Lately,

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:32.830
North Qi has been raiding Qingzhou.

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:35.680
My family also perished in the war.

00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:37.440
On my way to Huajing,

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:38.640
I encountered bandits.

00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:41.070
They took all my possessions

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:43.030
and slashed my leg.

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:46.160
Have bandits become so rampant

00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:48.070
as to commit violence

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:49.680
right under the Emperor's nose?

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:52.140
Do you have any relatives

00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:53.270
or friends in Huajing?

00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:01.720
Times are tough.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:03.840
It seems

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:05.310
you're a pitiable man.

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.160
I've paid

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:08.350
for five days in this room.

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:10.270
Since you have no belongings

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:11.310
and no friends or family,

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:12.750
just stay here and recover.

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:17.240
It's getting late.

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:18.240
I must leave now.

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:21.520
Wait.

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:27.310
Will you come back?

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:34.750
I just don't want to owe you a favor.

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:37.240
I'll repay you

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:38.160
for the room

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:39.030
and the medicine.

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:41.200
Of course, I'll come back.

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:42.790
Your dressing needs to be changed.

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:45.220
As for repaying the money,

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:47.310
we can talk about it

00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:48.640
once you're mostly recovered.

00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:50.030
You won't just leave

00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:51.070
without a word, will you?

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:18.920
My Lady,

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:20.440
I've sent the physician back.

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:21.550
It's getting late.

00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:23.070
Let's head back now.

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:55.780
(Laws Aid Morals)

00:19:58.200 --> 00:19:59.510
Make way, please.

00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:19.590
Isn't that General Yao?

00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:20.550
Oh, it's him.

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:23.950
He must've done something serious.

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:25.670
Indeed.

00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:38.060
(To be executed, Yao Yong)

00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:42.310
Isn't that Young Marquis Wei?

00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:43.150
Yes, it is.

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:44.920
Why is he here?

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:46.440
Indeed.

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:50.830
I heard you spoke well of me

00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:51.960
to the Crown Prince,

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.720
which earned me this opportunity.

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:56.680
Is that to repay my favor?

00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:58.110
Yes,

00:20:58.110 --> 00:20:58.960
but not entirely.

00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:00.680
Apart from repaying you

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:02.000
for saving my life,

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:03.110
I also did that

00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:04.630
for Chu Yu

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:06.240
and my family.

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:28.640
I never expected that before my end,

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:30.680
you'd personally

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:31.920
see me off.

00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:33.400
I've lived a life

00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:35.400
worth living.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.630
You stole the blueprints
of the octagonal crossbow for North Qi,

00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:40.100
killed 30,000 Chu troops,

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:42.790
colluded with North Qi
to fabricate military intelligence,

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:45.200
and conspired to kill 70,000 Wei troops.

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:47.550
The fact that you're still alive

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:49.610
is already a gift from the heavens.

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:50.800
Indeed.

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:52.070
I did it.

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:53.750
Trading my life

00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:55.790
for seven men in your family

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:57.750
and 100,000 Wei and Chu troops

00:21:57.750 --> 00:21:58.790
of Great Sui

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:00.110
is more than enough

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:01.790
for me.

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:06.510
No need to provoke me with your words.

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:08.980
Yao Yong,

00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:10.400
you believe that the Lord of Qin

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.400
died wrongfully,

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:13.000
so you've harbored such hatred

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.310
against Great Sui and His Majesty

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:15.440
that you even allied

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:16.310
with North Qi

00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:17.790
to hand Great Sui over to them.

00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:18.960
I used to be

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:20.790
the Lord of Qin's attendant,

00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:22.510
so I've always lived in suspicion

00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:24.320
and never been trusted.

00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:26.510
A wise bird chooses its perch.

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:31.440
Under Emperor Chunde's rule,

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:32.680
Great Sui would fall

00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:34.400
into someone else's hands

00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:36.400
sooner or later,

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:37.240
even if not North Qi.

00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:42.540
What are you laughing at?

00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:47.790
I'm laughing at how
you're still in the dark

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:51.440
even at the brink of death.

00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:56.400
Was the Lord of Qin truly innocent?

00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:58.400
If he hadn't been so gullible,

00:22:58.740 --> 00:22:59.920
how could our military secrets

00:22:59.930 --> 00:23:01.030
have reached North Qi,

00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:02.440
leading to the loss of three cities?

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:04.960
Your so-called righteous ruler

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:06.790
was outmaneuvered by North Qi

00:23:06.790 --> 00:23:08.440
and became a prisoner.

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:10.720
It's not a wrongful death at all.

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:12.270
And yet, you

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:15.160
still worked for North Qi.

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:16.680
That's impossible.

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:18.200
It was Emperor Chunde's jealousy

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:19.260
of the Lord of Qin's talent

00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:20.880
that led to his wrongful death.

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:26.830
So, you didn't know

00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:29.750
that the weapon of your revenge

00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:31.130
was pointed in the wrong direction.

00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:33.590
You've been working

00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:34.720
for your true enemies,

00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:37.130
and no one was willing
to tell you the truth?

00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:39.680
Now,

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:41.920
I can't tell

00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:44.810
whether you're more pitiable

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:47.830
or more detestable.

00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:49.680
Wei Yun...

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.750
Today, I've chosen to tell you this

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:54.680
because I want to let you know

00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:56.930
that no matter what reason you have,

00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:58.720
it's not a justification

00:23:58.720 --> 00:23:59.850
for betraying your country.

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:05.720
Throughout history,

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:08.550
traitors have had only one end.

00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:12.480
- Kill him!
- Kill him!

00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:13.720
Kill him!

00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:17.790
- Kill him!
- Kill him!

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:20.270
This traitor deserves no pity.

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:21.720
He's caused so many deaths.

00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:23.440
Kill him!

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:24.280
Young Marquis,

00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:27.680
stop wasting your breath.

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:31.750
I'm a man already marked for death.

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:34.680
If I repent now,

00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:37.510
wouldn't my whole life

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:39.920
become a joke?

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.140
I'm not just saying this

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:45.000
to you

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:46.310
but also to others

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:48.200
who harbor ill intentions.

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:51.160
In Great Sui,

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:53.270
we have not only rats like you,

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:55.700
but also families like the Wei family

00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:56.680
and the Chu family,

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:58.440
who wholeheartedly protect our country.

00:24:59.310 --> 00:25:00.680
Only with Great Sui's existence

00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:02.340
do the commoners have the right

00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:03.710
to live in peace and contentment.

00:25:03.730 --> 00:25:05.160
Only then do officials and generals

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:07.160
have the chance
to be remembered in history.

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:10.080
Great Sui

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.920
will always be the people's nation.

00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:17.440
- Well said!
- Well said!

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:19.310
Young Marquis Wei is right.

00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:20.240
Only with Great Sui

00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:21.480
can the people live in peace.

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:22.590
He deserves to die.

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:23.830
Well said!

00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:25.240
Kill him! Kill him!

00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:26.310
Well said!

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:28.000
Kill him! Kill him!

00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:29.240
A general

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:31.510
who has brought harm to the nation

00:25:31.790 --> 00:25:32.750
deserves to die!

00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:34.680
He deserves to die!

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:36.960
He deserves to die!

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:38.830
Instead of being a good official,

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:40.750
you chose to sneak around.

00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:42.000
Fine.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.550
Since you liked stealing my blueprints,

00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:45.270
I'll burn

00:25:45.270 --> 00:25:46.720
more paper money for him today.

00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:48.510
Well said! Well said!

00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:49.350
Kill him! Kill him!

00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:50.050
If it were me,

00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:51.680
I wouldn't even burn paper money
for him.

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:53.000
I'd dig up his ancestors' graves.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:53.840
Scoundrel!

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:17.030
Kill him! Kill him!

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:22.200
Yao Yong colluded with North Qi,

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:23.790
betrayed his country,

00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:26.160
stole Great Sui's military secrets,

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:28.440
killed 100,000 of Great Sui's troops,

00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:30.990
ordered the assassination
of the Eldest Princess,

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:33.510
and attempted to murder court officials.

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:35.510
His crimes

00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:37.070
are heinous.

00:26:38.270 --> 00:26:39.590
By the Emperor's decree,

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:41.510
Yao Yong is stripped of his generalship

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:43.680
and sentenced to beheading.

00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:46.240
His entire family is exiled.

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:50.030
Marquis Wei Yun will execute him.

00:26:56.850 --> 00:26:58.120
He deserves to die.

00:26:58.120 --> 00:26:58.960
Indeed.

00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:07.260
(To be executed)

00:27:21.790 --> 00:27:22.630
Execute!

00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:32.030
- Good!
- Good!

00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:34.750
- Great!
- Great!

00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:36.000
He deserved to die.

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:38.510
- Great!
- Great!

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:03.080
(Father,)

00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:05.350
(Mother,)

00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:08.200

00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:17.160
(avenged you all.)

00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:24.510
The winter in Huajing City has passed.

00:28:28.030 --> 00:28:28.870
Father,

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:31.920
you can rest in peace now.

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:37.240
Linyang,

00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:38.850
though Yao Yong is dead,

00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:40.350
there are surely more

00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:41.510
North Qi collaborators.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:42.840
One day,

00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:45.310
we will eliminate them all.

Yun.

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:01.240
Lan.

00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:03.640
Have Jue and Lingmo

00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:05.000
settled in?

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:05.740
Jue's hometown

is not far from Huajing.

If you miss them,

00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:09.030
I'll send someone to take you there.

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:11.830
Why did you come out alone today?

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:14.270
A few days ago, I saved someone

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:15.920
who was severely injured.

00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:17.510
I couldn't bear to leave him,

00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:19.400
so I arranged for him
to stay at the inn.

00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:23.170
I'll leave you to your work

00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:23.920
and head back now.

00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:32.910
Don't worry.

00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:33.960
I've sent someone

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:35.200
to secretly protect Ms. Wang.

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:36.680
Don't tell her yet.

00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:38.400
She's close to giving birth.

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:39.830
If anything happens,

00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:40.670
it wouldn't be good.

00:30:42.510 --> 00:30:43.550
This man is injured

00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:45.000
and won't be going out

00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:46.240
to find his contact

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:47.200
anytime soon.

00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:48.750
Keep a close watch.

00:30:49.550 --> 00:30:50.390
If necessary,

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:52.680
we'll have

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:53.590
to flush him out.

- Celebrating!

00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:01.270
(It's been a while.)

00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:03.720
She should be coming back.

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:06.760
Celebrating!

Yu, look.

00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:26.510
The recoil force is smaller now,

00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:29.640
but I still haven't been able to test

00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:31.590
the more accurate values.

00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:35.270
As expected of you.

00:31:35.550 --> 00:31:36.400
You're amazing.

00:31:38.550 --> 00:31:39.440
However,

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.550
though adjusting the arrows

00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:43.480
can alleviate the issue of recoil,

00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:45.240
it cannot completely solve it.

00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:47.590
If we want to promote
the octagonal crossbow,

00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:48.830
it seems

00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:50.680
we need to find more suitable materials

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:51.830
for the mechanism.

00:31:56.030 --> 00:31:56.920
Did Wei Yun

00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:58.520
tell you this?

00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:02.350
Yu,

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:05.200
be honest with me.

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:06.900
What's really going on

00:32:07.790 --> 00:32:08.960
between you and Wei Yun?

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:13.440
Last time in the small village,

00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:15.400
when I pretended to be the officiant,

00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:17.360
I could tell that what's between you

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:18.640
is far

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:20.100
from just a cooperation.

00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:23.430
Yu,

00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:24.960
I didn't stop you

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:26.270
when you followed Gu Chusheng

00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:27.920
to the southwest,

00:32:29.270 --> 00:32:30.350
nor did I stop you

00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:32.310
when you married Wei Jun alone,

00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:34.030
dressed in wedding clothes,

00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:36.260
to investigate the octagonal crossbow.

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:38.680
I didn't interfere once or twice

00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:40.440
because I know

00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:41.590
that's just your nature.

00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:48.110
But Yu,

00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:49.790
this is the third time,

00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:51.920
and I have to remind you now.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:53.940
Be honest with yourself.

00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:55.040
Ask yourself:

00:32:56.030 --> 00:32:56.970
What do you truly feel

00:32:58.160 --> 00:32:59.440
for Wei Yun?

00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:16.960
Sometimes, being together every day

00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:18.510
makes it hard to see clearly.

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:20.040
A few days apart

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:21.640
might help you figure it out.

00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:25.960
Don't worry, Linyang.

00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:27.750
I've already refused him.

00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:29.550
But you're right.

00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:31.590
I do need some more time

00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:32.640
to think it through.

00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:36.030
After all, I'm not a child anymore.

00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:51.550
Duke of Hu,

00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:54.310
do you know how sincere
the Crown Prince is?

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:55.920
He chose

00:33:56.110 --> 00:33:57.550
these betrothal gifts

00:33:57.550 --> 00:33:58.550
one by one

00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:01.240
by himself.

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:04.030
Today, he even delivered them himself.

00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:05.720
It shows how sincere he is

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.670
toward Miss Song.

00:34:14.590 --> 00:34:15.590
Look at this birdcage.

00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:17.150
The Crown Prince

00:34:17.590 --> 00:34:18.670
designed it personally

00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:21.110
for Miss Song.

00:34:22.070 --> 00:34:23.150
There's no other like it

00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:25.510
in all of Great Sui.

00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:27.550
Why bring this up?

00:34:28.110 --> 00:34:29.670
Qingping will be my wife.

00:34:30.030 --> 00:34:31.070
She naturally deserves

00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:32.280
the finest things.

00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:34.720
Duke of Hu,

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:37.030
where is Qingping today?

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:40.240
Your Highness,

00:34:42.110 --> 00:34:43.440
this birdcage

00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:44.880
is indeed unique.

00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:47.400
It's a good thing it's one of a kind.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.000
If you had prepared

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:51.320
another one for someone else,

00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:52.880
then Qingping

00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:54.360
shouldn't accept

00:34:54.670 --> 00:34:55.960
this gift.

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:02.900
The matter of the mistress
is already in the past.

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:08.840
As you can see,

00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:11.400
when Father was ill,

00:35:12.070 --> 00:35:13.510
I was worried every day.

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:16.710
I helped relieve Father's worries

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:18.010
by promoting capable officials

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:19.670
and even apologized to Wei Yun.

00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:21.800
Once Father recovered,

00:35:22.110 --> 00:35:23.030
I immediately

00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:24.000
brought

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.060
these betrothal gifts here.

00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:27.840
You've been

00:35:28.110 --> 00:35:29.320
doing well lately.

00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:32.280
Let me look at the list of gifts.

00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:37.110
Indeed, no one can be as generous

00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:38.360
as the Crown Prince.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:40.840
Coral.

00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:43.510
A goldfinch.

00:35:46.070 --> 00:35:47.840
These are all rare treasures

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:49.190
in Huajing.

00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:50.880
Don't you agree, Shilan?

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:51.720
Put it back.

00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:55.990
However,

00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:58.480
our mansion is too small

00:35:58.880 --> 00:35:59.920
to accommodate

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:00.960
such noble gifts.

00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:02.350
Your Highness,

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:03.670
why not wait

00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:04.880
until we've made some room

00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:06.000
before sending

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.880
the betrothal gifts?

00:36:08.070 --> 00:36:08.910
Wenchang,

00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:10.730
why are you here, spoiling the fun

00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:12.440
instead of studying in your room?

00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:14.070
Song Wenchang,

00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:16.190
what do you mean?

00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:18.840
My betrothal to Qingping

00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:19.760
was decided long ago.

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:21.730
Are you defying the imperial decree?

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:26.840
Moreover,

00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:28.840
this is between Qingping and me.

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:30.500
If there are any objections,

00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:32.000
Qingping should come

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:32.960
and speak to me herself.

00:36:36.070 --> 00:36:36.920
Since you think

00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:38.020
your mansion is too small,

00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:39.650
you can move these things

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:41.070
to the courtyard.

00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:44.720
Duke of Hu,

00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:46.070
goodbye.

00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:00.510
Power can be oppressive!

00:37:00.850 --> 00:37:01.710
Wenchang.

00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:02.550
Song Shilan,

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:04.250
why didn't you say anything just now?

00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:05.120
Are you mute?

00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:07.200
Don't you know who Tuantuan likes?

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:07.860
Besides,

00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:09.310
I can't stand Tuantuan being wronged

00:37:09.310 --> 00:37:10.350
even before her marriage.

00:37:10.350 --> 00:37:12.200
Which eye do you think
I'd let go of Tuantuan?

00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:15.700
Only the one who tied the bell
can untie it.

00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:17.590
Only if Tuantuan speaks up

00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:18.870
can this be resolved.

00:37:21.110 --> 00:37:22.320
Shilan is right.

00:37:23.110 --> 00:37:24.000
You two

00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:25.440
should talk to Qingping again.

00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:27.440
If she still refuses,

00:37:28.070 --> 00:37:29.840
I'll risk my life

00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:31.200
to break off the betrothal

00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:33.030
between the Crown Prince and her.

00:37:52.590 --> 00:37:53.650
Has the Crown Prince left?

00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:56.030
He left behind a pile

00:37:56.190 --> 00:37:57.310
of exquisite betrothal gifts.

00:37:57.920 --> 00:37:59.030
Especially the birdcage,

00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:00.360
the goldfinch inside

00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:01.660
is the most precious of all.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:03.880
Wenchang,

00:38:04.590 --> 00:38:05.630
what's so great

00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:06.670
about a bird in a cage?

00:38:07.070 --> 00:38:08.190
If you like it so much,

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:09.460
you marry him on my behalf.

00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:11.280
Look at you, so full of resentment.

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:13.360
If you don't want to marry, just say it.

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:30.720
Tuantuan,

00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:32.360
do you remember?

00:38:33.710 --> 00:38:34.590
When we were little,

00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:36.840
Father kept a parrot.

00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:38.350
It would use

00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:40.320
its foot to kick open

00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:42.920
its cage door.

00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:45.960
You always said

00:38:47.070 --> 00:38:48.070
that if only you could be

00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:51.670
like Ms. Chu

00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:54.110
and take control of your life.

00:38:58.320 --> 00:38:59.920
Chu Yu is like a bird

00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:01.100
that can't be kept in a cage,

00:39:01.590 --> 00:39:02.440
but I'm not.

00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:04.160
Why not?

00:39:10.110 --> 00:39:11.000
Can I?

00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:13.190
Even I

00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:14.230
can win over Jin.

00:39:14.590 --> 00:39:15.440
If I can,

00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:16.400
why can't you?

00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:19.640
Wenchang,

00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:20.920
that's because you happened

00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:22.400
to catch the eye of Ms. Chu Jin.

00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:24.320
That doesn't comfort me at all.

00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:26.150
- I...
- Tuantuan,

00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:27.030
if you think that way,

00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:28.360
you're making a big mistake.

00:39:34.030 --> 00:39:34.870
Tuantuan,

00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:36.880
listen to me.

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:38.880
Life is short.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.440
If you can't spend it

00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:42.380
with the one you love,

00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:43.670
doing what you love,

00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:45.630
isn't that a waste?

00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:51.440
Just follow your heart.

00:39:52.070 --> 00:39:52.910
If anything happens,

00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:54.070
we and the old man

00:39:54.510 --> 00:39:55.920
will cover for you.

00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:21.390
Li Huan.

00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:23.990
Qingping.

00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:27.350
Qingping.

00:40:28.590 --> 00:40:29.430
Take it back.

00:40:35.130 --> 00:40:36.380
Don't you like it?

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:38.200
Didn't you say

00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:39.190
you loved birds?

00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:41.790
I do like birds,

00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:43.520
but it's not because they sit

00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:44.870
in a cage for me to admire,

00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:45.880
but because they can

00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:46.780
fly freely

00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:47.880
in the sky.

00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:51.720
Your Highness,

00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:54.070
if you truly care for me,

00:40:55.110 --> 00:40:56.290
please ask His Majesty

00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:57.260
to revoke the betrothal.

00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:04.580
You don't want to marry me

00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:07.000
because I kept a mistress, right?

00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:09.470
If that's the case,

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:11.030
I can assure you

00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:12.630
it will never

00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:13.670
happen again.

00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:16.590
If an emperor favors only one woman

00:41:17.070 --> 00:41:18.400
and takes no other consorts,

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:19.820
that would be

00:41:19.830 --> 00:41:21.150
truly shocking.

00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:22.710
That's not the reason

00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:24.080
why I don't want to marry you.

00:41:24.590 --> 00:41:25.480
Then why?

00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:34.030
Is it because

00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:35.960
of Chu Linyang?

00:41:38.110 --> 00:41:38.830
I've heard

00:41:38.830 --> 00:41:40.080
you two have been close lately.

00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:41.030
It's because of him,

00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:42.880
but not entirely.

00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:44.550
Your Highness,

00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:46.800
I don't care about power

00:41:47.070 --> 00:41:48.630
or the dream

00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:49.800
of ruling the world.

00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:55.110
I just want to know

00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:56.960
how many herbs I haven't collected

00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:58.230
left in the mountains,

00:41:58.970 --> 00:42:00.840
why smallpox can't be completely cured,

00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:03.440
and what other uses
there are for Mafeisan

00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:05.230
besides removing bone-deep poison.

00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:08.030
I don't want to be stopped

00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:09.030
by those high walls.

00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:10.000
If I can't give you that,

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:10.920
can Chu Linyang

00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:11.840
do it?

00:42:15.790 --> 00:42:16.840
I do like Chu Linyang,

00:42:17.590 --> 00:42:18.820
but if one day

00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:20.140
he becomes

00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:21.360
the wall in my way,

00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:23.310
I won't stop

00:42:23.310 --> 00:42:24.160
for him, either.

00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:41.670
Even a little bird

00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:43.590
will struggle to get out

00:42:43.590 --> 00:42:44.880
if there's the slightest opening.

00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:49.360
And I will never give up

00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:51.400
if there is

00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:52.710
the slightest chance.

00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:55.060
If you want me to be
a phoenix in a cage,

00:42:55.510 --> 00:42:56.510
I'd rather be a sparrow

00:42:56.510 --> 00:42:57.670
that roams freely.

00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:04.070
Please grant me this, Your Highness.

00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:23.460
Let's go to the Chu Mansion.

00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:26.990
Son,

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:28.630
tell me the truth.

00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:31.000
Did you offend the Crown Prince?

00:43:33.070 --> 00:43:34.030
Why do you ask, Mother?

00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:37.110
He looked quite upset

00:43:37.110 --> 00:43:38.110
when he came,

00:43:38.710 --> 00:43:40.510
as if he was here to reprimand us.

00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:44.510
Don't worry, Mother.

00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:46.500
I think I know

00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:47.590
why the Crown Prince came.

00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:48.790
Don't worry.

00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:50.290
Everything will be fine.

00:43:57.920 --> 00:43:58.760
Mother.

00:43:59.550 --> 00:44:00.400
Jin,

00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:01.240
you're back.

00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:02.350
Did you

00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:03.840
find out anything?

00:44:04.110 --> 00:44:05.070
I heard that today,

00:44:05.070 --> 00:44:06.480
the Crown Prince left the Palace

00:44:06.630 --> 00:44:08.820
to deliver betrothal gifts
to the Duke of Hu,

00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:10.400
but he had an unpleasant encounter

00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:11.550
with Miss Song.

00:44:11.550 --> 00:44:12.880
Miss Song?

00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:15.920
Miss Song

00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:17.360
keeps seeking out your brother.

00:44:17.790 --> 00:44:19.180
It's obvious to anyone with eyes

00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:20.540
that she has feelings for him.

00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:25.820
Oh, no.

00:44:26.110 --> 00:44:27.510
She must've upset

00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:28.670
the Crown Prince.

00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:30.510
Is he here to vent his anger?

00:44:32.710 --> 00:44:34.000
We can't afford to offend

00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:35.440
either the Crown Prince

00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:37.800
or the Duke of Hu.

00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:42.120
Mother,

00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:43.200
don't worry.

00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:45.150
Since Linyang dared

00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:46.210
to meet the Crown Prince,

00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:47.320
he must be

00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:48.190
very confident.

00:44:48.550 --> 00:44:49.800
Everything will surely be fine.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:55.880
I hope so.
