00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.839
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:32.192
- Greetings, Your Majesty.
- Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:35.039
I brought the seal. Release them.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.439
Imperial Weaving House's Master
and assassin Cheng Ge

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:44.960
plotted to assassinate His Majesty.

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:47.479
His Majesty is young and lacks judgment,

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:48.520
misplacing his trust.

00:00:48.759 --> 00:00:51.240
The imperial seal shall now
be managed by the Prince Regent

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:52.679
to secure the realm.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.039
I

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.079
will not fail Your Majesty.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.792
I will perform virtuous deeds

00:00:57.792 --> 00:00:59.399
and seek prosperity for the people.

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:01.600
- We shall not fail Your Majesty
- We shall not fail Your Majesty

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.039
- and seek prosperity for the people.
- and seek prosperity for the people.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:10.400
Release them.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.480
Your Majesty, you are not wise.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.959
These two bound here
are treasonous rebels

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.640
and eternal criminals
who attempted regicide.

00:01:30.048 --> 00:01:31.104
Release them.

00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:36.879
Your Highness.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.799
Your Majesty,
though you are compassionate,

00:01:40.448 --> 00:01:41.879
these two individuals

00:01:42.239 --> 00:01:45.359
do carry legitimate suspicion
of assassination attempts.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.920
However,

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:48.680
between them,

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.104
one is the mastermind

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.599
and the other an accomplice.

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:57.408
Your Majesty.

00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:02.439
Now,

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:05.120
the accomplice may be spared,

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:06.879
but the mastermind

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.439
must be executed.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.080
Your Majesty.

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:15.080
Who is the mastermind?

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:17.199
Who is the accomplice?

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.439
Since you address me as Lord Father,

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:26.360
I bear the duty to guide your conduct.

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:27.840
Today's matter

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.199
is my lesson for you
on discerning right from wrong.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.719
Who is the mastermind?
And who is the accomplice?

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.439
Please make the judgment yourself.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.439
Did the weaving house's Master

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:04.280
train assassin Cheng Ge
to kill Your Majesty?

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:06.560
Or did Cheng Ge of Pingxiang lineage

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.639
manipulate the weaving house's Master
into regicide?

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.520
This matter today

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.280
requires an explanation
to the entire court.

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:34.208
Your Majesty,

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:37.439
indecisiveness

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.360
is no virtue.

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:43.800
I'll count to three.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.680
If you cannot decide,

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.599
then I

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:50.719
will have to choose in your stead.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:53.439
One.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.800
Two.

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:09.840
Three.

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:15.488
Shield His Highness!

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:19.808
Nan!

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:21.600
Shield His Highness!

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.639
Your Highness, hurry!

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.816
Nan!

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:34.240
Nan!

00:04:34.519 --> 00:04:35.439
Master!

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:38.319
Live well.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.399
Be a good Emperor.

00:04:43.808 --> 00:04:46.040
I'll never let anyone bully you again.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.040
Okay.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.439
Master.

00:05:00.519 --> 00:05:01.439
Master!

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.800
What's your name?

00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:08.879
Cheng Ge.

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:11.079
Master!

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.839
Master.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:18.399
Nan.

00:05:18.592 --> 00:05:19.480
Master!

00:05:19.959 --> 00:05:20.720
Nan!

00:06:03.079 --> 00:06:04.320
Your Grace, spare me!

00:06:04.399 --> 00:06:04.920
Zhiying!

00:06:05.319 --> 00:06:05.839
Ji.

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:08.000
You can't kill him now.

00:06:09.519 --> 00:06:12.448
Do you know what he's done to me?

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:13.879
I know.

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:18.519
I'm begging you.

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:20.439
Endure a bit more, okay?

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:21.439
Endure a bit more.

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:22.720
It'll all be over soon.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.248
How's the wedding banquet

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.000
preparation?

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:13.639
My lord,

00:07:13.879 --> 00:07:15.319
everything's ready.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:16.560
It begins at noon.

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:20.240
Good.

00:07:40.224 --> 00:07:41.720
Why haven't you killed me yet?

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:43.240
No need to rush.

00:07:44.544 --> 00:07:45.759
I've arranged

00:07:46.079 --> 00:07:48.040
the way you die.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.240
On the wedding day,

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:54.279
an assassin appeared.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:56.199
Prince Regent Gao Ji captured Cheng Ge,

00:07:56.199 --> 00:07:58.199
the assassin planted
by His Majesty's side

00:07:58.199 --> 00:08:00.439
under the guise of a waiting maid.

00:08:00.736 --> 00:08:03.008
Yet unfortunately, His Majesty

00:08:03.008 --> 00:08:04.920
was assassinated.

00:08:05.279 --> 00:08:06.000
Therefore,

00:08:06.839 --> 00:08:08.639
the royal heir the Empress is carrying

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.319
shall ascend the throne.

00:08:16.399 --> 00:08:18.120
You petty man who fabricates history!

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:20.480
Guards!

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:26.208
Your Highness.

00:08:27.519 --> 00:08:28.800
For a waiting maid

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:32.039
to be dressed by others before death,

00:08:32.832 --> 00:08:35.120
I suppose that's a proper end, right?

00:08:36.519 --> 00:08:37.480
Dress her.

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:38.679
Yes.

00:09:36.279 --> 00:09:37.679
The Prince Regent has arrived.

00:09:40.639 --> 00:09:41.480
Greetings.

00:09:41.919 --> 00:09:43.159
- Greetings, Your Highness.
- Greetings, Your Highness.

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.399
You've all endured a long journey.

00:09:45.399 --> 00:09:46.320
Efforts appreciated.

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:47.919
Take your seats.

00:09:52.279 --> 00:09:54.496
His Majesty has arrived.

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.159
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:10:07.159 --> 00:10:09.000
Greetings, Your Grace.

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:10.320
Rise.

00:10:12.159 --> 00:10:12.639
Be seated.

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:17.840
Everyone!

00:10:18.759 --> 00:10:20.360
Today marks a joyous occasion.

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:24.192
Our empire is blessed with divine signs
and the impending royal birth.

00:10:24.192 --> 00:10:25.720
Let us raise our cups together

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:27.200
to celebrate

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:30.120
for His Majesty and Her Grace.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.440
The envoys have traveled
great distances to our nation.

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:49.279
Let us all enjoy this joyous occasion.

00:10:49.519 --> 00:10:52.080
Today, let formalities be set aside.

00:10:52.279 --> 00:10:53.344
Enjoy the feast!

00:10:53.824 --> 00:10:54.679
Let the feast begin!

00:11:00.519 --> 00:11:01.639
His Highness said

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:03.480
if you succeed in this mission,

00:11:04.039 --> 00:11:06.080
you'll be rewarded
with titles and lands.

00:11:06.759 --> 00:11:10.320
Then we'll thank His Highness
and you in advance.

00:11:10.799 --> 00:11:13.600
The rest shall act
when the cup shatters.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.080
Strike immediately

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:16.399
and kill Shi Yu.

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.080
Complete this,

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:21.840
and you will enjoy wealth for life.

00:11:22.879 --> 00:11:23.679
- Yes!
- Yes!

00:11:48.799 --> 00:11:49.856
Assassins!

00:11:50.759 --> 00:11:51.840
Guard His Majesty!

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:52.879
Guard Her Grace!

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:55.744
Capture the assassins alive

00:11:55.919 --> 00:11:56.879
at all costs!

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.272
Remain calm, everyone.

00:12:03.136 --> 00:12:05.159
On this auspicious occasion,

00:12:05.879 --> 00:12:08.000
assassins dared attack His Majesty.

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:10.480
This outrage cannot stand!

00:12:10.679 --> 00:12:13.080
I will give an account to everyone here

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:14.320
and also

00:12:15.392 --> 00:12:16.440
to His Majesty.

00:12:19.776 --> 00:12:20.759
Report!

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:23.279
Assassins have been captured.
