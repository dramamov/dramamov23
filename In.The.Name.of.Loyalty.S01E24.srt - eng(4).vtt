=Episode 24=

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:30.120
Report!

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.399
Assassins have been captured.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.880
Bring them in.

00:00:41.728 --> 00:00:42.336
Kneel!

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.744
Kneel!

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.439
So audacious!

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:51.079
How dare you attempt regicide
on this joyous occasion!

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:52.520
Who are you really?

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.359
Aren't you Cheng Ge,
His Majesty's waiting maid?

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.159
So the assassin disguised herself
as a waiting maid,

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.200
lurking around His Majesty for long.

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:13.840
She is Cheng Ge,

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.560
with parents from Pingxiang.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.159
To avenge the Pingxiang rebellion,

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:18.528
she served as a waiting maid,

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.879
solely to kill this tyrant.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.599
Am I right?

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.120
Gao Ji,

00:01:35.328 --> 00:01:36.319
this act of yours

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.239
is poorly performed.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.359
Attempting to murder His Majesty

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:47.239
defies heaven's law
and merits execution.

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:49.120
Any last words?

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.239
Heaven's justice will prevail.

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:53.640
Reflect on your actions.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:55.920
The evidence is irrefutable.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.040
Execute without mercy!

00:01:57.239 --> 00:01:58.519
Without my permission,

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.120
who dares touch her?

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:01.280
Your Majesty!

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.280
It's conclusive that Cheng Ge tried

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.159
to assassinate you!

00:02:05.519 --> 00:02:07.480
Execute her now
to eliminate future trouble.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.680
Everyone, stop!

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.639
I have something to say.

00:02:15.392 --> 00:02:18.080
Thank you all
for attending this celebration.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.599
But I must tell you one thing.

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:23.599
The child I carry

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.280
is not His Majesty's.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.319
What did you say?

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:31.400
Ji!

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:33.039
Stop now.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.360
It's not too late to turn back.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.240
Not too late?

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.240
Do you even know what you're saying?

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:38.520
For whom do you think

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.639
I made all these plans?

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:40.960
Haven't I done it all for you?

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.159
If I fall,

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.680
who will protect you?

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.400
But this isn't the life I want!

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:49.479
Ji,

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:51.960
I wish you weren't Prince Regent,

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.199
and I weren't Empress.

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:54.800
Regal splendor?

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.879
You don't even know what I truly want.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.560
Her Grace is unwell,

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:02.759
suffering delusions!

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:03.479
Guards!

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:04.280
Ji.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.680
- Escort her back.
- Your Grace.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.479
Ji, stop before it's too late.

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:10.439
You'll know everything I did
was for your sake!

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:11.599
It's too late.

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:14.360
I have to finish what I started today!

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:15.319
- Ji.
- Your Grace.

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:16.520
Ji, stop this.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.528
Stop being blind to the truth!

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.319
Ji!

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:29.759
- Hurry!
- Attack!

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:36.159
Emperor Shi Yu ruled in tyranny
and slaughtered Pingxiang people.

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:38.800
Today, we'll claim vengeance!

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:49.719
They've finally come.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.000
Gao Ji,

00:03:54.176 --> 00:03:55.639
a treacherous rebel who conducted

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:56.879
regicide and treason,

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.080
deceiving the crown,
killing the late Emperor,

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.759
and altering the history.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.639
Nonsense!

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.199
My entire life

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.360
has been devoted to the nation.

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:11.120
On the path to greatness,

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:13.039
one must overcome obstacles.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.719
Everything I did was for His Majesty.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.360
So what if I

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:17.560
crushed a few ants?

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.800
What did I do wrong?

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:24.759
But you, Shi Yu!

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.240
You're indecisive and fatuous.

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:31.648
Like your brother,

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:34.199
you're unfit to be Emperor.

00:04:44.519 --> 00:04:45.839
The ants you killed

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:48.800
were someone's siblings and parents.

00:04:48.959 --> 00:04:50.399
They were living people!

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.399
You trampled on lives.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.040
This is your deserved end.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.920
This strike

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.959
is for my deceased parents

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:00.120
and the people of Pingxiang.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:02.399
Gao Ji,

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.199
you manipulated politics

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:05.800
and murdered my brother.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.360
Your crime is unforgivable,

00:05:08.256 --> 00:05:10.079
yet you parade as a loyal official.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.000
In the end,

00:05:12.519 --> 00:05:14.519
you acted only for personal gain.

00:05:15.519 --> 00:05:16.040
You

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.240
are unworthy to be my subject.

00:05:19.296 --> 00:05:20.240
My entire life

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.800
has been devoted to this nation.

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:28.600
For this nation,

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.399
I sacrificed everything and gave my all.

00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:34.279
What did I do wrong?

00:05:35.959 --> 00:05:36.800
I am...

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:39.759
I am

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:41.560
a loyal official.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:43.720
All of this

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.040
is recorded by historians.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.840
Historians!

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.839
Y-Yes.

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:50.519
Read it.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.399
During today's banquet,

00:05:52.399 --> 00:05:54.624
the Prince Regent arranged assassins
to kill His Majesty

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.000
and attempted to frame
His Majesty's waiting maid.

00:05:57.439 --> 00:05:59.879
Knowing that the Empress
carried no imperial heir,

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:01.639
he still hosted grand feasts

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:03.319
to entertain foreign envoys.

00:06:03.399 --> 00:06:04.560
When exposed,

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.304
he tried to eliminate all witnesses,

00:06:06.304 --> 00:06:07.720
disregarding diplomatic decorum.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.600
He has been a traitor for ages.

00:06:14.816 --> 00:06:15.439
No.

00:06:16.959 --> 00:06:17.879
That's not how it was.

00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:19.439
That's not true.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.680
That's not true.

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:22.160
That's not how it was.

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:23.600
That's not how it was.

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:46.400
General Yan, hear my command!

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:06:48.439 --> 00:06:49.680
Eliminate Gao Ji's faction.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.560
Leave no evil standing.

00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:52.319
Yes!

00:07:23.959 --> 00:07:24.759
It's over now.

00:07:41.199 --> 00:07:42.199
Bad news,

00:07:42.199 --> 00:07:43.199
Your Grace!

00:07:44.384 --> 00:07:46.432
The Prince Regent has been killed.

00:07:51.264 --> 00:07:52.240
What did you say?

00:07:53.399 --> 00:07:54.639
The Prince Regent

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.360
has been killed.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:10.639
Your Grace!

00:08:10.639 --> 00:08:12.399
- Your Grace!
- Your Grace!

00:08:13.312 --> 00:08:15.000
- Your Grace!
- Help!

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.759
Her Grace has fainted!

00:08:17.312 --> 00:08:18.519
Your Grace!

00:08:19.104 --> 00:08:21.728
- Your Grace!
- Her Grace has fainted!

00:08:21.728 --> 00:08:23.296
- Your Grace!
- Help!

00:08:23.296 --> 00:08:25.000
- Your Grace!
- Help!

00:08:49.184 --> 00:08:52.032
(Memorial tablet of Shi Nan,
Memorial tablet of Gao Ji)

00:08:53.216 --> 00:08:55.559
Are you alright?

00:08:58.519 --> 00:08:59.759
Cultivating virtue and peace,

00:09:00.096 --> 00:09:01.200
I'm content now.

00:09:01.679 --> 00:09:02.360
If you wish,

00:09:03.559 --> 00:09:04.480
you may return anytime.

00:09:07.679 --> 00:09:10.159
Through all these trials,
I've gained clarity.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:11.279
Your Majesty,

00:09:11.799 --> 00:09:12.919
please don't dwell on it.

00:09:13.919 --> 00:09:14.799
I shall remain here,

00:09:15.279 --> 00:09:16.919
praying for you, the people,

00:09:17.919 --> 00:09:19.519
and also the nation's prosperity.

00:09:29.952 --> 00:09:30.559
Your Majesty.

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:34.039
Your Majesty, all has been restored

00:09:34.279 --> 00:09:35.120
as you commanded.

00:09:35.799 --> 00:09:38.600
Gao Ji was buried with royal honors
as the imperial uncle.

00:09:42.759 --> 00:09:43.159
Let's go.

(Memorial tablet of Pingxiang people,
Memorial tablet of Shi Nan)

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:00.840
Nan,

00:10:01.879 --> 00:10:02.480
don't worry.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.039
I'll strive to be a worthy Emperor

00:10:07.104 --> 00:10:09.000
and prevent another Pingxiang tragedy.

00:10:10.759 --> 00:10:11.519
From now on,

00:10:13.024 --> 00:10:14.000
I'll write our destiny.

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:15.936
Master,

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:17.559
we did it.

00:10:18.759 --> 00:10:20.639
From now on, I'll stay by Shi Yu's side,

00:10:22.559 --> 00:10:23.399
ensuring his safety.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:35.000
Someone.

00:10:37.472 --> 00:10:38.120
Your Majesty.

00:10:38.799 --> 00:10:39.720
I have things to do.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.320
You return first.

00:10:42.304 --> 00:10:43.360
Your Majesty, this...

00:10:44.192 --> 00:10:46.360
T-This breaches protocol.

00:10:47.712 --> 00:10:48.600
Why are you fighting?

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:55.679
Your Majesty. Your Majesty.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:56.864
There's no one.

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:00.080
Your Majesty!

00:11:01.056 --> 00:11:01.919
Your Majesty!

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:09.480
Is it really okay?

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.600
You are no longer the same as before.

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:13.960
You need to deal with

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:15.519
numerous matters at the court.

00:11:25.639 --> 00:11:26.960
It's just a half a day's leave.

00:11:28.399 --> 00:11:30.919
My Empress and I are traveling incognito

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:31.960
to see people's lives.

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:33.408
What's wrong with that?

00:11:36.032 --> 00:11:37.639
Who said I'd be your Empress?

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:41.840
You have no choice but to accept.

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:43.399
Will you defy my decree?

00:11:45.039 --> 00:11:46.399
Empress sounds boring.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.279
What is not boring then?

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:51.240
My love?

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:52.639
Noble Consort?

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:56.000
You're my only woman anyway,

00:11:57.679 --> 00:11:58.600
so you're responsible.
