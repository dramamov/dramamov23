Bunty…?

00:00:25.213 --> 00:00:26.548
Bunty…

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:29.425
Bunty!

00:01:17.599 --> 00:01:19.350
You should sleep closer to the middle.

00:01:20.685 --> 00:01:23.813
I've fallen off every third night.
I'm used to it now.

00:01:23.897 --> 00:01:25.315
That's not something to get used to.

00:01:25.982 --> 00:01:27.400
Also…

00:01:27.483 --> 00:01:28.902
This morning,

00:01:28.985 --> 00:01:31.779
-I thought I heard a voice.
-A voice?

00:01:32.572 --> 00:01:34.157
A voice saying, "Don't die."

00:01:35.408 --> 00:01:36.618
I said that out loud?

00:01:37.702 --> 00:01:38.536
Huh?

00:01:39.954 --> 00:01:42.999
I keep having this dream… where you die.

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:45.960
Not often, but it feels so real.

00:01:46.044 --> 00:01:49.339
It's different from any other dream.

00:01:51.341 --> 00:01:53.468
She lost her husband in an accident.

00:01:53.551 --> 00:01:54.928
He died right in front of her.

00:01:55.011 --> 00:01:56.930
She's projecting her late husband

00:01:57.013 --> 00:01:59.432
onto you, Bunta.

00:02:04.687 --> 00:02:05.521
Alright.

00:02:16.783 --> 00:02:18.701
Why do I keep dreaming that?

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:20.995
Even when I'm so happy.

00:02:31.547 --> 00:02:35.343
Shiki isn't an employee of Nonamare

00:02:35.426 --> 00:02:37.512
or an Esper.

00:02:37.595 --> 00:02:39.389
Why does she live in company housing?

00:02:40.098 --> 00:02:42.183
Boss said she's the daughter of a friend

00:02:42.267 --> 00:02:44.602
and was asked to look after her.

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.232
It was rough at first. She almost
followed her husband to the grave.

00:02:49.941 --> 00:02:51.526
So, Mrs. Enjaku stayed near her.

00:02:58.157 --> 00:02:59.867
That's…

00:02:59.951 --> 00:03:03.246
That's dangerous. Give it to me, okay?

00:03:07.333 --> 00:03:08.751
Your husband's coming home.

00:03:09.752 --> 00:03:10.753
He's on a…

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:13.548
long business trip.

00:03:14.757 --> 00:03:16.718
He's on a long business trip.

00:03:23.474 --> 00:03:24.684
Business trip?

00:03:24.767 --> 00:03:26.728
Yes. Let's…

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:29.605
wait for him together.

00:03:30.148 --> 00:03:31.024
Alright?

00:03:37.363 --> 00:03:40.950
That was just a lie Mrs. Enjaku told
to keep her safe,

00:03:42.243 --> 00:03:45.496
but strangely enough, Shiki accepted it.

00:03:46.205 --> 00:03:48.541
Bit by bit, she got better.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.086
What's his name?

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.839
-Sasuke.
-Sasuke, huh?

00:03:55.423 --> 00:03:58.968
Sasuke, you're so cute.

00:03:59.052 --> 00:04:01.929
Nice to meet you. A present for you.

00:04:02.555 --> 00:04:03.973
Thank you.

00:04:04.057 --> 00:04:06.559
My name uses the kanji
"Sakura" and "Suke". I'm Ohsuke.

00:04:07.226 --> 00:04:08.978
We started hosting takoyaki nights

00:04:09.062 --> 00:04:11.105
to cheer her up.

00:04:12.523 --> 00:04:14.984
So, there's history
behind those takoyaki nights.

00:04:15.068 --> 00:04:17.695
She'd been stable for a long time,

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:20.740
but lately, she's started
breaking down again.

00:04:20.823 --> 00:04:24.160
She realized her husband's
not coming back.

00:04:24.994 --> 00:04:27.413
Of course she would.

00:04:27.497 --> 00:04:30.291
But giving her another man instead

00:04:30.375 --> 00:04:32.085
and her believing I'm him

00:04:32.168 --> 00:04:34.670
is also insane.

00:04:34.754 --> 00:04:36.297
It really is, isn't it?

00:04:38.549 --> 00:04:41.219
Hanzo, what did you do

00:04:41.302 --> 00:04:44.263
before joining Nonamare?

00:04:49.602 --> 00:04:52.563
Mrs. Enjaku lives very simply.

00:04:54.899 --> 00:04:56.067
Really?

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:57.235
CLEANEX TOOTHPASTE

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:01.155
She only buys things on sale…

00:05:01.239 --> 00:05:02.198
PROVERBS FROM AROUND THE WORLD

00:05:02.281 --> 00:05:04.075
…reads borrowed library books,

00:05:04.158 --> 00:05:06.619
writes out sutras every day
with a ballpoint pen.

00:05:07.328 --> 00:05:08.204
She lives purely,

00:05:08.287 --> 00:05:11.374
freeing herself from desire.

00:05:12.125 --> 00:05:15.044
-She has no family?
-None.

00:05:15.128 --> 00:05:17.797
She's been through a lot.

00:05:20.216 --> 00:05:22.343
So, what did you use to--

00:05:22.427 --> 00:05:24.429
No matter how much I pull weeds,
it never ends.

00:05:24.512 --> 00:05:26.431
I love this smell though.

00:05:26.514 --> 00:05:28.349
Grassy… What do you call it?

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:31.686
This smell! Hey, what's it called?

00:05:31.769 --> 00:05:33.521
The smell is different depending on…

00:05:33.604 --> 00:05:37.316
What, you're curious
about Hanzo or something?

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.317
No…

00:05:39.193 --> 00:05:41.612
Not exactly,

00:05:41.696 --> 00:05:44.157
but when someone hides something,
it makes me curious.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.617
He's an animal nut.

00:05:46.701 --> 00:05:48.452
Everyone knows that!

00:05:49.162 --> 00:05:52.331
He's taken in strays
and even bought a few.

00:05:52.415 --> 00:05:55.293
He says that he can't resist
when they ask to come home with him.

00:05:56.002 --> 00:05:59.505
Now he avoids pet shops.

00:05:59.589 --> 00:06:00.673
Sorry, Kuroda.

00:06:01.507 --> 00:06:02.466
At home, he's basically

00:06:03.134 --> 00:06:05.261
scooping poop all day.

00:06:05.344 --> 00:06:06.637
Are you itchy?

00:06:06.721 --> 00:06:07.847
Does he have family?

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:08.764
The animals.

00:06:08.848 --> 00:06:10.892
Everyone knows that!

00:06:12.768 --> 00:06:14.562
Not entirely.

00:06:18.399 --> 00:06:19.400
Actually…

00:06:25.031 --> 00:06:26.157
he's killed someone.

00:06:29.327 --> 00:06:32.205
Strange company, strange jobs…

00:06:33.956 --> 00:06:36.918
I figured none of the staff were ordinary.

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:40.588
Guess life's full of surprises.

00:06:41.589 --> 00:06:42.924
Who do you mean?

00:06:44.467 --> 00:06:45.801
Well…

00:06:48.137 --> 00:06:49.347
Ohsuke may seem rough,

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:51.807
but he's not a bad kid.

00:06:52.516 --> 00:06:54.977
He's had his past,

00:06:55.519 --> 00:06:57.980
but now he's serious
about his work with Nonamare

00:06:58.064 --> 00:06:59.023
and his flower shop.

00:07:00.274 --> 00:07:01.692
He's always been a florist?

00:07:01.776 --> 00:07:04.445
No, he started after becoming an Esper.

00:07:06.572 --> 00:07:08.783
Boss approved it

00:07:08.866 --> 00:07:10.618
since a florist cover

00:07:10.701 --> 00:07:12.370
could be useful for missions.

00:07:12.453 --> 00:07:14.914
He even rented the place for him.

00:07:19.502 --> 00:07:21.170
All done with separating.

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:25.967
Weeding, litter pickup, recycling…

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:28.135
You always do this?

00:07:28.219 --> 00:07:29.804
When there's no mission, yes.

00:07:29.887 --> 00:07:32.890
These little acts
are just as important as our work.

00:07:33.724 --> 00:07:35.518
Our work, huh?

00:07:38.062 --> 00:07:40.690
Listen well. You are heroes

00:07:40.773 --> 00:07:43.109
who save the world.

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:48.447
Heroes must have responsibility
and strong ethics.

00:07:48.531 --> 00:07:49.365
Yes.

00:07:49.991 --> 00:07:51.075
Something as simple

00:07:51.158 --> 00:07:53.786
as cleaning your neighborhood.

00:07:53.869 --> 00:07:57.081
It may seem trivial, but…

00:07:58.749 --> 00:08:02.169
those small steps

00:08:02.253 --> 00:08:03.921
are what eventually save the world.

00:08:08.134 --> 00:08:08.968
Yes?

00:08:09.051 --> 00:08:11.846
I get your ideals, President.

00:08:11.929 --> 00:08:13.306
I do, but…

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:17.226
Having a clearer goal

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:20.771
would make it easier to work toward.

00:08:21.355 --> 00:08:22.189
Bunta,

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:24.400
do you think happiness

00:08:24.483 --> 00:08:27.528
can be quantified?

00:08:28.988 --> 00:08:31.324
Can you put a number on saving the world,

00:08:32.199 --> 00:08:34.869
such as in money or sales?

00:08:36.996 --> 00:08:39.790
That mindset is the problem!

00:08:39.874 --> 00:08:40.958
That is why you embezzled

00:08:41.042 --> 00:08:44.420
and ruined your life.

00:08:44.503 --> 00:08:46.797
You let numbers rule you.

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:51.886
Illness begins in the mind.

00:08:51.969 --> 00:08:53.512
So does heroism.

00:08:55.181 --> 00:08:56.140
Is that a slogan?

00:08:56.223 --> 00:08:58.351
-Bunta!
-Yes?

00:08:58.434 --> 00:09:02.229
"I'm just a bit of an Esper

00:09:02.313 --> 00:09:04.023
and just a bit of a hero."

00:09:04.899 --> 00:09:05.733
Say it.

00:09:07.485 --> 00:09:09.570
-What?
-"I…"

00:09:12.531 --> 00:09:16.494
I'm… just a bit of an Esper

00:09:16.577 --> 00:09:18.954
and just a bit of a hero…?

00:09:19.038 --> 00:09:20.289
It's not a question.

00:09:21.499 --> 00:09:24.335
I'm just a bit of an Esper

00:09:24.418 --> 00:09:25.711
and just a bit of a hero.

00:09:25.795 --> 00:09:27.296
With more feeling.

00:09:28.673 --> 00:09:30.091
-I'm--
-Take it seriously!

00:09:31.717 --> 00:09:34.637
I'm just a bit of an Esper

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.639
-and just a bit of a hero!
-With conviction!

00:09:36.722 --> 00:09:39.266
I'm just a bit of an Esper
and just a bit of a hero!

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:41.644
-One more time!
-I'm just a bit of an Esper and…!

00:10:08.087 --> 00:10:09.338
You already ate some.

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.549
No more dried sweet potatoes.

00:10:12.383 --> 00:10:13.342
I'm not stingy.

00:10:14.009 --> 00:10:17.304
I just can't trust him.

00:10:17.388 --> 00:10:20.141
-Who?
-President Kizashi.

00:10:20.224 --> 00:10:22.351
He talks big,

00:10:22.435 --> 00:10:24.270
but there's no passion…

00:10:24.353 --> 00:10:25.855
I feel like he's just showing off.

00:10:25.938 --> 00:10:27.606
Well, he's cool.

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:29.900
Anyone can look that cool

00:10:29.984 --> 00:10:32.820
if they've got money and leisure.
Anyone can.

00:10:32.903 --> 00:10:35.281
-Really?
-Well…

00:10:35.364 --> 00:10:37.867
Sure, at least to that extent.

00:10:38.409 --> 00:10:41.579
-Mrs. Enjaku, come on!
-All right, let's do this.

00:10:41.662 --> 00:10:43.581
Ready… go!

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:47.877
Don't warm up people's bladders.

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:50.838
-What did that feel like?
-A new sensation.

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:52.882
-Don't make me laugh!
-Concentrate!

00:10:53.966 --> 00:10:54.842
Go!

00:10:55.926 --> 00:10:57.052
More!

00:11:00.222 --> 00:11:01.223
And… time!

00:11:03.058 --> 00:11:04.268
The result…

00:11:04.351 --> 00:11:06.854
It's a record.
Thirty-five point six degrees!

00:11:06.937 --> 00:11:09.940
-Oh!
-Yes! Up by one degree.

00:11:10.024 --> 00:11:12.067
Human body temperature!

00:11:13.235 --> 00:11:15.446
It sure is peaceful.

00:11:15.529 --> 00:11:19.241
Drinking in daylight,
training useless powers,

00:11:19.325 --> 00:11:22.578
getting paid for picking up trash…

00:11:22.661 --> 00:11:24.413
That's our modern hero?

00:11:24.497 --> 00:11:27.082
-Is it okay to be this relaxed?
-If you hate it, quit.

00:11:27.166 --> 00:11:30.044
Hate it? No way!

00:11:30.127 --> 00:11:33.964
If anything, I wish I'd found
this kind of job sooner.

00:11:34.048 --> 00:11:35.591
-Another round!
-Make it yourself.

00:11:35.674 --> 00:11:36.550
Yes, sir.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.180
I don't even get what being a hero means.

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:44.141
What's the point of every mission?

00:11:51.857 --> 00:11:54.360
-Want me to make yours too?
-No, really, it's okay.

00:11:54.443 --> 00:11:56.237
-It's no trouble.
-Really,

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.405
I couldn't ask you.

00:11:59.907 --> 00:12:00.741
Huh?

00:12:09.625 --> 00:12:13.087
-Ohsuke, you said something again?
-Huh?

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:16.131
You told him I'm a murderer again, right?

00:12:16.674 --> 00:12:18.884
-See!
-See!

00:12:19.718 --> 00:12:21.512
Knock it off already!

00:12:21.595 --> 00:12:23.055
-It's not true?
-Of course not!

00:12:23.138 --> 00:12:25.975
-You almost killed him, though.
-Yeah, almost.

00:12:26.058 --> 00:12:27.935
He lived, luckily.

00:12:28.018 --> 00:12:31.188
Hanzo used to be a cop.

00:12:31.272 --> 00:12:33.816
-A police officer?
-K-9 unit.

00:12:37.194 --> 00:12:39.280
Please keep it a secret.
I don't like talking about it.

00:12:39.363 --> 00:12:41.615
He beat up a guy who abused dogs.

00:12:41.699 --> 00:12:43.492
It was worse than that!

00:12:43.576 --> 00:12:45.619
He crammed 50 dogs

00:12:45.703 --> 00:12:47.621
into a tiny room to breed them.

00:12:47.705 --> 00:12:49.623
I reported him to Animal Control
and to my boss,

00:12:49.707 --> 00:12:51.166
but they said their hands were tied.

00:12:53.252 --> 00:12:54.378
Right?

00:12:55.879 --> 00:12:57.047
It was awful.

00:12:57.756 --> 00:12:59.425
I broke in

00:12:59.508 --> 00:13:02.094
to free them all,

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:06.098
but I got caught halfway through
and fought back.

00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:09.810
-You almost killed him?
-Yes.

00:13:10.561 --> 00:13:12.354
The animals were saved,

00:13:12.438 --> 00:13:15.524
but I went to prison and got fired.

00:13:15.608 --> 00:13:18.027
I really thought it was my calling.

00:13:18.652 --> 00:13:19.862
Back then,

00:13:19.945 --> 00:13:23.240
-you weren't an Esper yet, right?
-No.

00:13:23.907 --> 00:13:26.327
But I always wished

00:13:27.369 --> 00:13:30.080
I could understand
what animals were feeling.

00:13:32.082 --> 00:13:33.000
They say E-Capsules

00:13:33.584 --> 00:13:36.086
change ability based on personality,

00:13:37.212 --> 00:13:39.673
but maybe they reflect your deepest wish.

00:13:40.966 --> 00:13:43.052
So, did I wish to make flowers bloom?

00:13:43.135 --> 00:13:45.387
What about you, Bunta? Any clue

00:13:45.471 --> 00:13:46.722
why you can hear thoughts?

00:13:49.308 --> 00:13:50.559
No, not really.

00:13:52.061 --> 00:13:54.938
I ran out of capsules. Give me one.

00:13:55.022 --> 00:13:57.066
Go get it yourself.

00:13:57.149 --> 00:13:59.610
Bunta, give me one of yours!

00:13:59.693 --> 00:14:03.447
I'm almost out too.
I'm picking up more tomorrow.

00:14:04.448 --> 00:14:07.534
Then go together.
Bunta, take Ohsuke with you.

00:14:17.586 --> 00:14:20.673
Ohsuke, I told you before

00:14:20.756 --> 00:14:23.300
to pick up your E-Capsules
while we still have stock.

00:14:23.384 --> 00:14:25.427
Yeah. Okay.

00:14:25.511 --> 00:14:28.180
Once the drug wears off,
you lose your powers.

00:14:28.263 --> 00:14:31.141
Then, you're automatically terminated.
No second chances.

00:14:33.352 --> 00:14:35.104
I always wondered…

00:14:35.187 --> 00:14:38.065
If it makes you an Esper,
shouldn't it be called

00:14:38.148 --> 00:14:39.650
an "ES-Capsule"?

00:14:42.444 --> 00:14:45.990
It's the E from ESP, so it's an E-Capsule.

00:14:47.825 --> 00:14:48.993
That makes sense!

00:14:49.076 --> 00:14:50.285
You always come

00:14:50.911 --> 00:14:52.705
at the last minute.

00:14:53.372 --> 00:14:55.749
You have no sense of responsibility.

00:14:57.167 --> 00:14:58.460
Yeah.

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:01.547
Bunta, you're exemplary.

00:15:02.131 --> 00:15:04.591
Always organized and always on schedule.

00:15:04.675 --> 00:15:06.427
That's just being professional.

00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:09.847
I'll remind him

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:11.890
about the next pickup.

00:15:11.974 --> 00:15:13.392
Much appreciated. Thanks.

00:15:13.475 --> 00:15:15.227
Not at all.

00:15:16.645 --> 00:15:19.356
Remember the rule.

00:15:19.898 --> 00:15:23.485
No one must ever know about your powers.

00:15:24.278 --> 00:15:25.279
Understood.

00:15:25.988 --> 00:15:28.991
And one more thing. Non amare.

00:15:29.616 --> 00:15:31.618
You must not love anyone.

00:15:33.579 --> 00:15:34.788
I love you.

00:15:39.752 --> 00:15:41.003
Just wondering…

00:15:41.086 --> 00:15:44.590
Why is there a rule

00:15:44.673 --> 00:15:45.716
to not love someone?

00:15:46.592 --> 00:15:50.763
You have a mission to complete.

00:15:51.638 --> 00:15:55.225
Nothing should matter
more than that mission.

00:15:57.019 --> 00:16:00.814
Love always clouds judgment

00:16:01.774 --> 00:16:03.609
and weakens resolve.

00:16:04.359 --> 00:16:05.944
A hero's love

00:16:06.028 --> 00:16:09.031
is even more forbidden than an idol's.

00:16:09.114 --> 00:16:10.574
But these days,

00:16:10.657 --> 00:16:14.244
even idols…

00:16:18.207 --> 00:16:20.876
That goes for family too, Ohsuke.

00:16:21.376 --> 00:16:23.837
I've been concerned
about your shop location choice.

00:16:23.921 --> 00:16:26.340
Maybe you're getting too close?

00:16:27.091 --> 00:16:28.884
Alright.

00:16:28.967 --> 00:16:30.677
I'm just watching.

00:16:30.761 --> 00:16:33.931
In your case, you have a unique situation.

00:16:34.014 --> 00:16:36.016
And with your situation, that's unwise.

00:16:37.101 --> 00:16:37.976
For your son too.

00:16:43.982 --> 00:16:45.067
Yes.

00:16:49.071 --> 00:16:53.033
-You sucked up to him.
-That's just how office life is.

00:16:53.117 --> 00:16:55.577
It's just standard company behavior.

00:16:56.703 --> 00:16:57.871
Office life, huh?

00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:03.293
You live with your son?

00:17:03.377 --> 00:17:06.046
What? I live alone.

00:17:07.506 --> 00:17:10.008
He doesn't even know who I am.

00:17:18.976 --> 00:17:21.645
Jeez… I'll get it next time.

00:17:21.728 --> 00:17:23.730
-How old is he? What's his name?
-Shion!

00:17:23.814 --> 00:17:24.857
Oh, later.

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:27.151
Shion. He's 17.

00:17:27.234 --> 00:17:28.694
Shion.

00:17:29.778 --> 00:17:30.821
It's a flower's name.

00:17:31.947 --> 00:17:34.491
I wanted to choose a flower name
like yours, Ohsuke.

00:17:34.575 --> 00:17:35.409
Yeah.

00:17:35.492 --> 00:17:36.451
What about this one?

00:17:36.535 --> 00:17:37.369
SHION

00:17:37.452 --> 00:17:38.871
Shion.

00:17:38.954 --> 00:17:42.207
It's a tiny, pale purple flower,
like a chrysanthemum.

00:17:43.041 --> 00:17:44.334
I can't read that!

00:17:45.669 --> 00:17:49.089
-Figures. I guess that's a no.
-No!

00:17:49.715 --> 00:17:52.092
-This is good.
-What? But you can't read it.

00:17:52.176 --> 00:17:54.428
He'll grow up smart,

00:17:54.511 --> 00:17:55.804
unlike me.

00:17:57.347 --> 00:17:58.182
SHION

00:17:58.265 --> 00:17:59.141
I see.

00:18:00.976 --> 00:18:02.477
Shion.

00:18:02.561 --> 00:18:04.980
Ohsuke, Shion is standing!

00:18:05.063 --> 00:18:06.398
You're a genius, Shion.

00:18:06.481 --> 00:18:08.025
You're a genius!

00:18:10.485 --> 00:18:13.989
You've eaten well. You're a genius!

00:18:19.411 --> 00:18:20.412
Thank you for your work.

00:18:20.495 --> 00:18:21.538
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:18:21.622 --> 00:18:23.290
I'll take these.

00:18:23.957 --> 00:18:26.168
-Working hard, huh?
-Since you're a dad now.

00:18:26.251 --> 00:18:27.127
Thanks!

00:18:36.178 --> 00:18:37.846
You're looking lively, Ohsuke!

00:18:49.233 --> 00:18:50.734
Huh?

00:18:52.986 --> 00:18:54.905
Smells fishy!

00:18:57.616 --> 00:18:59.451
Is this what you're eating?

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:03.705
-Please leave me alone.
-What?

00:19:03.789 --> 00:19:06.041
I came all the way here to offer you work

00:19:06.124 --> 00:19:07.918
that pays better

00:19:08.001 --> 00:19:10.128
than sweating on a boat.

00:19:12.965 --> 00:19:16.885
There's no one left to run things.
You know the ropes, don't you?

00:19:16.969 --> 00:19:18.929
Trust me on this.

00:19:21.932 --> 00:19:24.851
I can't skip my boat job.

00:19:27.062 --> 00:19:28.981
Relax.

00:19:29.064 --> 00:19:32.442
I'll take care of your wife and kid.
All of you.

00:19:36.029 --> 00:19:38.198
Shion, right?

00:19:44.413 --> 00:19:46.957
Better decide while I'm still being nice.

00:20:06.101 --> 00:20:07.019
Okay.

00:20:07.102 --> 00:20:10.188
Good. Two hours to pack up.

00:20:17.863 --> 00:20:21.283
Hey, bring the car to the fishing port.

00:20:22.075 --> 00:20:24.119
Yeah. He…

00:20:36.715 --> 00:20:40.594
The bastard didn't survive.

00:20:42.095 --> 00:20:45.140
Unlike Hanzo, I chose to kill him.

00:20:46.933 --> 00:20:48.226
Why did you beat him

00:20:49.061 --> 00:20:51.521
until he died?

00:20:53.231 --> 00:20:55.359
If I'd stopped halfway,
he'd have come after us.

00:20:57.486 --> 00:20:59.529
You could've run.

00:21:01.114 --> 00:21:03.325
If I could, I wouldn't have done it.

00:21:04.743 --> 00:21:06.161
You turned Shion…

00:21:10.999 --> 00:21:13.710
into a murderer's son.

00:21:17.964 --> 00:21:19.508
What I regretted most

00:21:19.591 --> 00:21:22.344
was the life I'd wasted up until now

00:21:23.512 --> 00:21:24.596
and dreaming

00:21:24.679 --> 00:21:27.933
of a normal, happy life.

00:21:31.853 --> 00:21:35.190
About two years later,
I got a letter from the court.

00:21:35.273 --> 00:21:36.274
CHIYODA REGIONAL COURT

00:21:36.358 --> 00:21:38.485
Mizuki's new husband

00:21:38.568 --> 00:21:40.112
had adopted Shion.

00:21:40.195 --> 00:21:42.614
Legally, he became his father.

00:21:46.993 --> 00:21:49.329
I was erased

00:21:49.413 --> 00:21:52.124
from Shion's life completely.

00:21:55.043 --> 00:21:56.294
That's how it should be.

00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:03.427
After I was released, the boss found me
and brought me into Nonamare.

00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:06.388
One mission took me near that town again.

00:22:09.057 --> 00:22:11.351
Hey, Shion!

00:22:11.935 --> 00:22:13.770
-Hey!
-Sorry, I'm late!

00:22:13.854 --> 00:22:15.564
You're late, Shion!

00:22:15.647 --> 00:22:18.316
-You have food at home?
-My mom said she'll make something.

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:19.693
Yes!

00:22:23.405 --> 00:22:26.491
-Tatsuya!
-Shion!

00:22:29.494 --> 00:22:31.746
-Good job!
-Nice!

00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:33.748
-I did it!
-You were so cool!

00:22:33.832 --> 00:22:35.250
A happy,

00:22:35.333 --> 00:22:37.460
ordinary life

00:22:38.128 --> 00:22:39.421
was right there.

00:22:39.504 --> 00:22:40.630
-Good job!
-Yeah.

00:22:42.883 --> 00:22:45.468
So, he doesn't need to know who I am.

00:22:48.513 --> 00:22:52.601
But I'll always see myself

00:22:52.684 --> 00:22:54.436
as his dad.

00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:57.606
Watching from afar is enough.

00:23:02.903 --> 00:23:05.947
FLOWER SHOP

00:23:08.283 --> 00:23:09.451
Hey.

00:23:10.076 --> 00:23:11.494
Don't tell anyone, okay?

00:23:12.245 --> 00:23:13.496
It's lame.

00:23:15.498 --> 00:23:17.083
It's not lame.

00:23:17.876 --> 00:23:19.127
You're a good dad.

00:23:20.795 --> 00:23:21.922
You idiot.

00:23:23.089 --> 00:23:24.633
I'm a murderer.

00:23:25.425 --> 00:23:29.012
Then you're the best dad among murderers.

00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:35.435
What does that even mean?

00:23:54.454 --> 00:23:55.372
Thanks.

00:23:58.708 --> 00:23:59.542
Alright.

00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:35.203
Were you remembering something?

00:24:36.663 --> 00:24:38.790
You can tell?

00:24:39.499 --> 00:24:41.084
Your back looked that way.

00:24:45.672 --> 00:24:48.216
I was remembering a back.

00:24:49.801 --> 00:24:50.885
My father's.

00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:56.641
My dad was impatient.

00:24:58.310 --> 00:25:00.603
You know how adults

00:25:00.687 --> 00:25:02.731
and kids have different strides?

00:25:04.357 --> 00:25:06.526
He was the kind of man
who couldn't see that.

00:25:08.278 --> 00:25:09.487
One day, he asked,

00:25:10.822 --> 00:25:13.408
"Wanna go to the festival?"

00:25:15.243 --> 00:25:17.078
It was rare,

00:25:17.162 --> 00:25:18.413
so I was so excited.

00:25:19.873 --> 00:25:21.541
He just kept

00:25:22.792 --> 00:25:24.419
walking ahead

00:25:24.502 --> 00:25:26.421
and never looked back.

00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:34.054
I lost him in the crowd

00:25:35.138 --> 00:25:37.265
and never reached the festival.

00:25:37.349 --> 00:25:39.642
Daddy…

00:25:42.437 --> 00:25:44.189
That's when I remembered…

00:25:45.523 --> 00:25:46.775
When I was little,

00:25:47.984 --> 00:25:51.863
I used to think, "If only I could hear

00:25:51.946 --> 00:25:53.365
what he was thinking."

00:25:54.449 --> 00:25:55.909
Like his thoughts?

00:25:57.827 --> 00:25:58.995
If…

00:26:00.205 --> 00:26:01.331
I could've heard them…

00:26:03.875 --> 00:26:07.128
I would've known he wasn't cold.

00:26:08.088 --> 00:26:10.840
He was just clumsy.

00:26:11.633 --> 00:26:14.928
Maybe he's thinking dearly of me.

00:26:16.221 --> 00:26:18.098
If I could hear his thoughts,

00:26:18.598 --> 00:26:20.350
I would have known that.

00:26:25.522 --> 00:26:29.609
I was such a pure, innocent kid.

00:26:33.071 --> 00:26:37.617
He remained the same
all the way to the end.

00:26:38.827 --> 00:26:41.246
He died in a hospital bed.

00:26:45.834 --> 00:26:47.544
I couldn't even cry.

00:26:50.839 --> 00:26:52.298
If the parent is like that,

00:26:54.008 --> 00:26:55.635
then the son would be the same.

00:27:09.607 --> 00:27:13.278
I wish I could pat little Bunty's head.

00:27:21.453 --> 00:27:23.121
There's a shrine festival

00:27:23.204 --> 00:27:25.415
in our neighborhood this weekend.

00:27:26.249 --> 00:27:27.250
Oh yeah?

00:27:29.878 --> 00:27:32.505
This year, let's wear our yukata
and go together.

00:27:36.092 --> 00:27:37.302
This year…

00:27:43.308 --> 00:27:44.309
Let's go.

00:27:45.018 --> 00:27:47.020
Let's go in a yukata this year.

00:27:58.865 --> 00:28:01.784
Mrs. Enjaku's here!

00:28:03.786 --> 00:28:07.040
Mrs. Enjaku's here!

00:28:07.123 --> 00:28:08.958
Please wait a sec!

00:28:09.584 --> 00:28:12.545
This Easy Bunko Bow for Beginners

00:28:12.629 --> 00:28:13.630
isn't easy at all!

00:28:13.713 --> 00:28:15.715
They underestimate beginners.

00:28:15.798 --> 00:28:17.300
I mean, I am a beginner!

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:19.177
How's this look?

00:28:21.888 --> 00:28:24.474
That's good! You look great, Bunty!

00:28:24.557 --> 00:28:27.393
Oh, need help with yours?

00:28:29.938 --> 00:28:31.356
Then…

00:28:32.732 --> 00:28:35.985
-How about this one?
-You picked the hardest one.

00:28:37.612 --> 00:28:38.613
Please.

00:28:41.908 --> 00:28:43.368
He insisted on coming.

00:28:43.451 --> 00:28:46.496
Want some grilled squid, Sasuke?

00:28:46.579 --> 00:28:49.207
No! If you feed him squid, he could die!

00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:51.543
-Seriously?
-Absolutely not!

00:28:51.626 --> 00:28:53.211
Oh, they're here!

00:28:53.294 --> 00:28:56.464
Sorry for the wait.

00:28:56.548 --> 00:28:58.550
-Look!
-Oh!

00:28:58.633 --> 00:29:00.760
Looks lovely!

00:29:00.844 --> 00:29:02.220
Bunty tied it for me.

00:29:04.806 --> 00:29:06.057
I forgot my camera. Hold on.

00:29:06.683 --> 00:29:08.768
You're good, Bunta.

00:29:08.852 --> 00:29:10.562
Just skilled with my hands.

00:29:13.398 --> 00:29:15.859
Right when it was getting fun…

00:29:15.942 --> 00:29:17.527
Hope it's an easy mission.

00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:19.612
-Now?
-It happens sometimes.

00:29:19.696 --> 00:29:22.240
Let's pretend we didn't see it.

00:29:23.408 --> 00:29:24.868
Mission 77.

00:29:24.951 --> 00:29:25.785
MISSION 77-SEPTEMBER 14, 2025 4:24 P.M.
STOP PEOPLE FROM DYING IN AN EXPLOSION

00:29:27.871 --> 00:29:30.331
"Stop people from dying in an explosion."

00:29:30.415 --> 00:29:31.749
Explosion?

00:29:31.833 --> 00:29:33.543
You're kidding.

00:29:33.626 --> 00:29:36.838
This… It says 4:24 p.m.

00:29:36.921 --> 00:29:39.424
That's less than 30 minutes!

00:29:39.507 --> 00:29:42.844
The location… It's the shrine
where the festival is at.

00:29:48.766 --> 00:29:50.894
IZUMI SHRINE SUMMER FESTIVAL

00:29:50.977 --> 00:29:51.811
HOTDOG

00:29:54.105 --> 00:29:55.356
You almost got it!

00:29:56.566 --> 00:29:58.276
Sorry for the wait.

00:30:01.279 --> 00:30:02.822
Let's go!

00:30:02.906 --> 00:30:05.658
Ah… You know…

00:30:09.662 --> 00:30:11.915
-What happened?
-Bunta!

00:30:11.998 --> 00:30:14.709
-Mrs. Enjaku!
-My heart… It hurts!

00:30:14.792 --> 00:30:15.877
Mrs. Enjaku? Are you okay?!

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:18.880
I can't move an inch!

00:30:18.963 --> 00:30:20.757
Ambulance! Bunty! Call the ambulance!

00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:23.092
No, I'll just rest!

00:30:23.176 --> 00:30:25.345
But the candy apples!

00:30:25.428 --> 00:30:27.597
-Candy apples?
-Yeah.

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:30.266
The famous shop is selling them!

00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:33.353
I have to buy them or they'll sell out!

00:30:34.145 --> 00:30:35.605
Candy apples!

00:30:35.688 --> 00:30:36.814
-That!
-Yeah!

00:30:36.898 --> 00:30:38.149
What "famous" shop?

00:30:38.858 --> 00:30:42.070
You don't know
the Apple-Star of candy apples?!

00:30:45.406 --> 00:30:47.367
-Don't move, the two of you!
-Yeah.

00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:48.868
-Hey! Let's go!
-Yeah!

00:30:48.952 --> 00:30:50.495
-Hey! Let's get the candy apples!
-Hey--

00:30:50.578 --> 00:30:52.038
IZUMI SHRINE SUMMER FESTIVAL

00:30:54.290 --> 00:30:57.251
-So many people…
-This isn't good.

00:30:57.335 --> 00:30:58.711
Only 20 minutes left!

00:30:59.712 --> 00:31:00.588
Hey!

00:31:01.506 --> 00:31:02.507
-That kid!
-Huh?

00:31:07.011 --> 00:31:08.846
-Who?
-Anyway,

00:31:08.930 --> 00:31:10.640
-let's find the bomb!
-Yes.

00:31:12.266 --> 00:31:14.227
IZUMI SHRINE SUMMER FESTIVAL

00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:15.353
Excuse me!

00:31:19.273 --> 00:31:20.024
Here you are.

00:31:20.108 --> 00:31:22.026
-Wow!
-Wait, that's a PlayStation 5!

00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:23.987
Five hundred yen per try.

00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:25.446
-Huh? Five hundred yen?
-Wait!

00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:27.699
-I'm not sure…
-Okay! Whoever loses, goes.

00:31:27.782 --> 00:31:29.951
-Okay!
-Rock paper scissors.

00:31:30.034 --> 00:31:31.536
Where is the bomb?

00:31:31.619 --> 00:31:34.122
Sorry! Excuse me!

00:31:35.164 --> 00:31:36.833
If you're going to do that…

00:31:36.916 --> 00:31:38.167
Excuse me!

00:31:38.251 --> 00:31:41.421
There might be an explosive here!

00:31:41.504 --> 00:31:42.755
We need to evacuate everyone!

00:31:42.839 --> 00:31:44.132
-Explosive?
-Oh!

00:31:44.215 --> 00:31:46.676
Please, find the explosive.

00:31:46.759 --> 00:31:49.762
Gun powder, gas.
Something that smells unusual.

00:31:50.763 --> 00:31:52.015
What's going to explode?

00:31:53.016 --> 00:31:55.226
-A boat.
-How do you know that?

00:31:55.309 --> 00:31:56.185
Because…

00:31:57.311 --> 00:31:59.022
someone said so!

00:31:59.105 --> 00:32:00.690
-A bomb threat?
-A bomb?

00:32:00.773 --> 00:32:02.942
Well, not a bomb…

00:32:03.026 --> 00:32:05.611
Could be a gas explosion!

00:32:07.488 --> 00:32:09.032
Eat before it gets cold.

00:32:09.115 --> 00:32:10.408
Ours is still hot. Eat up.

00:32:10.491 --> 00:32:12.660
-Um… There might be an explosion!
-You know…

00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:14.704
Jeez!

00:32:18.583 --> 00:32:22.211
YAKISOBA

00:32:26.924 --> 00:32:28.468
That's dangerous!

00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:30.344
Excuse me.

00:32:30.928 --> 00:32:32.221
Huh?

00:32:48.988 --> 00:32:49.822
Go!

00:32:51.741 --> 00:32:53.993
-It's you, huh?
-Who are you guys?

00:32:54.077 --> 00:32:55.661
There's a strange smell from your bag.

00:32:55.745 --> 00:32:58.414
-Are you carrying something?
-Nothing at all.

00:32:58.498 --> 00:33:00.333
Please let us check your bag.

00:33:00.416 --> 00:33:01.459
Why? You're not cops.

00:33:01.542 --> 00:33:03.086
Show us, punk!

00:33:03.169 --> 00:33:05.463
No way! Why should I?

00:33:08.091 --> 00:33:09.300
Understood.

00:33:09.926 --> 00:33:11.427
You don't have to show us anything.

00:33:12.303 --> 00:33:14.180
From now on, you don't have to answer

00:33:15.306 --> 00:33:16.390
any of my questions.

00:33:18.976 --> 00:33:20.311
What's

00:33:20.895 --> 00:33:22.271
in that bag?

00:33:27.401 --> 00:33:28.569
Wait!

00:33:28.653 --> 00:33:31.197
What's in there?

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:46.921
Got you!

00:33:48.422 --> 00:33:50.341
What's

00:33:50.925 --> 00:33:54.679
-in the bag?
-He knew. It's over.

00:33:55.346 --> 00:33:56.681
It's him!

00:33:56.764 --> 00:33:57.598
That's him!

00:33:57.682 --> 00:33:58.850
-It's him!
-Yeah!

00:33:59.475 --> 00:34:01.144
-Hey!
-Hand it over!

00:34:01.227 --> 00:34:02.270
-Hey!
-Be careful!

00:34:02.353 --> 00:34:03.938
-It's dangerous! Don't go near!
-Hey!

00:34:04.021 --> 00:34:06.107
-Oh!
-Oh no!

00:34:10.153 --> 00:34:13.906
MODEL SHIP, GAMES, CD

00:34:16.534 --> 00:34:18.452
-You thief!
-Hey! It's a shoplifter!

00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:20.830
-I'm sorry!
-What happened?

00:34:20.913 --> 00:34:22.874
-Shoplifting?
-Hey!

00:34:23.457 --> 00:34:24.500
Dried sweet potato?

00:34:25.293 --> 00:34:28.296
Please find the thing
that's going to explode!

00:34:28.379 --> 00:34:29.380
Please!

00:34:29.463 --> 00:34:31.507
TAKOYAKI

00:34:31.591 --> 00:34:33.426
Dad!

00:34:35.052 --> 00:34:36.721
Dad!

00:34:37.388 --> 00:34:38.723
Dad!

00:34:41.184 --> 00:34:42.685
-Dad!
-Go!

00:34:44.395 --> 00:34:46.105
Dad!

00:34:47.857 --> 00:34:49.901
Daddy!

00:34:52.653 --> 00:34:54.906
Dad!

00:34:54.989 --> 00:34:57.033
Dad!

00:35:00.077 --> 00:35:01.120
Here?

00:35:01.204 --> 00:35:03.581
-Gas leak! Here!
-Dad!

00:35:03.664 --> 00:35:05.625
Dad!

00:35:09.921 --> 00:35:11.088
-Close it!
-Yeah.

00:35:11.631 --> 00:35:13.049
-Everyone back!
-Sorry!

00:35:13.132 --> 00:35:14.717
-Please!
-Get away!

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:16.594
-Please!
-Get away!

00:35:16.677 --> 00:35:18.846
Who shut it off?

00:35:27.438 --> 00:35:29.190
-Sorry!
-Run! It's gonna blow!

00:35:32.735 --> 00:35:34.362
YAKISOBA

00:35:39.242 --> 00:35:40.451
Get down!

00:35:58.469 --> 00:35:59.720
What's that?

00:36:11.065 --> 00:36:13.818
-Sorry.
-Excuse me!

00:36:13.901 --> 00:36:15.278
Excuse me!

00:36:15.361 --> 00:36:16.946
Coming through!

00:36:18.114 --> 00:36:18.990
Are you okay?

00:36:19.782 --> 00:36:22.451
-Don't panic. Leave slowly.
-Excuse me.

00:36:22.535 --> 00:36:24.412
-Don't panic. Leave slowly.
-Excuse me.

00:36:24.495 --> 00:36:25.496
Leave slowly.

00:36:38.801 --> 00:36:40.011
Bunty!

00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:42.305
Shiki.

00:36:43.389 --> 00:36:45.891
I heard there was an explosion.

00:36:45.975 --> 00:36:47.560
There was a small one.

00:36:47.643 --> 00:36:49.979
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:52.315
No one got hurt?

00:36:52.398 --> 00:36:54.734
Hanzo got a scratch.

00:36:55.943 --> 00:36:56.944
It's nothing.

00:36:58.738 --> 00:37:00.865
We missed the festival,

00:37:01.490 --> 00:37:04.285
but we did get this.

00:37:04.368 --> 00:37:05.494
APPLE-STAR CANDY APPLE

00:37:10.916 --> 00:37:12.376
Who saved you?

00:37:13.711 --> 00:37:16.047
It wasn't my dad. A stranger.

00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:17.173
Kota!

00:37:17.923 --> 00:37:20.509
Sorry, Kota! Are you okay?

00:37:20.593 --> 00:37:22.887
I didn't see his face.

00:37:22.970 --> 00:37:24.013
That was insane!

00:37:24.555 --> 00:37:26.307
He lifted the whole griddle!

00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:28.517
Without him, we'd have been hurt.

00:37:28.601 --> 00:37:29.769
-Yeah.
-Right…

00:37:30.895 --> 00:37:32.730
Please don't enter.

00:37:52.458 --> 00:37:54.627
There's an unknown factor.

00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:56.587
It seems like an unverified element.

00:37:57.338 --> 00:38:00.591
We still don't know what it is.

00:38:02.802 --> 00:38:06.055
The order came at the last minute,

00:38:06.639 --> 00:38:08.265
but the mission succeeded.

00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:11.644
The shrine festival

00:38:11.727 --> 00:38:13.729
will be held again next year.

00:38:15.272 --> 00:38:17.817
The world changes easily,

00:38:19.318 --> 00:38:21.278
not always as we wish.

00:38:22.488 --> 00:38:23.656
Its branches

00:38:24.824 --> 00:38:27.827
are fragile… and short-lived.

00:38:30.996 --> 00:38:31.831
Bud.

00:38:36.252 --> 00:38:37.128
Peony.

00:38:40.756 --> 00:38:41.882
Pine needles.

00:38:46.595 --> 00:38:47.763
Falling chrysanthemum.

00:38:58.482 --> 00:38:59.483
The end.

00:39:02.445 --> 00:39:04.613
Such a short-lived life, huh?

00:39:08.659 --> 00:39:10.244
-Here.
-Thanks.

00:39:15.916 --> 00:39:17.460
I wanted to buy you

00:39:17.543 --> 00:39:20.296
something you liked at the festival.

00:39:21.046 --> 00:39:22.590
-Something I like?
-Yeah.

00:39:22.673 --> 00:39:24.175
Everything you want.

00:39:24.258 --> 00:39:26.385
For the little Bunty too.

00:39:28.721 --> 00:39:30.639
You're a strong woman,

00:39:31.932 --> 00:39:35.478
like a pickling stone.
Why don't you try to be more like pumice?

00:39:35.561 --> 00:39:38.355
Pumice? The one you scrub your heels with?

00:39:38.439 --> 00:39:41.692
Yeah. It's full of holes and super light.

00:39:41.775 --> 00:39:43.068
That's not me.

00:39:46.906 --> 00:39:50.159
You must've received

00:39:51.202 --> 00:39:54.246
real love

00:39:54.330 --> 00:39:55.873
from your parents.

00:39:58.334 --> 00:40:01.212
That's why you can love others
without hesitation.

00:40:03.172 --> 00:40:04.548
Like a pickling stone.

00:40:06.675 --> 00:40:10.429
You talk like you're not the one I love.

00:40:21.273 --> 00:40:22.316
Today…

00:40:23.526 --> 00:40:24.610
I saw him.

00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:28.614
The little me,

00:40:29.698 --> 00:40:31.367
crying after being left behind.

00:40:34.912 --> 00:40:36.413
I saved him.

00:40:39.041 --> 00:40:40.584
I'm glad I could.

00:40:46.215 --> 00:40:50.344
For humans, maybe saving yourself…

00:40:52.513 --> 00:40:54.682
is the hardest thing to do.

00:41:18.872 --> 00:41:19.748
Hey.

00:41:20.791 --> 00:41:22.626
Here, your treat.

00:41:25.045 --> 00:41:27.756
It's just a small cut. I'll heal soon.

00:41:30.759 --> 00:41:32.136
You're welcome.

00:41:40.978 --> 00:41:42.813
No.

00:41:43.897 --> 00:41:46.317
It's not that I miss my former partner.

00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:48.277
I keep it there

00:41:49.528 --> 00:41:50.863
to remind myself

00:41:51.697 --> 00:41:53.324
never to lose anyone again.

00:41:53.407 --> 00:41:56.285
Mrs. Enjaku, this yakisoba's great.

00:41:56.368 --> 00:41:57.620
I'm glad.

00:42:01.373 --> 00:42:03.584
You bite that candy apple bold.

00:42:03.667 --> 00:42:05.794
Biting is the best part.

00:42:05.878 --> 00:42:07.463
An old boyfriend taught me that.

00:42:08.839 --> 00:42:11.717
-What a bad guy, huh?
-Yeah.

00:42:12.384 --> 00:42:14.053
He ruined my life.

00:42:46.210 --> 00:42:49.254
Just a bit of Esper

00:42:49.338 --> 00:42:51.507
Just a bit of hero

00:42:51.590 --> 00:42:54.051
Just a bit…

00:42:55.177 --> 00:42:56.220
How about work?

00:42:56.303 --> 00:42:58.681
-Got a fever.
-What?

00:43:01.850 --> 00:43:04.144
I called the shop and told them
I'll take the day off.

00:43:05.521 --> 00:43:06.855
Are you okay?

00:43:09.733 --> 00:43:10.859
Do you need anything?

00:43:10.943 --> 00:43:13.862
I'm fine. Stay safe.

00:43:15.406 --> 00:43:16.573
I'm off.

00:43:40.931 --> 00:43:41.974
This!

00:43:42.808 --> 00:43:43.767
This!

00:43:46.061 --> 00:43:47.104
Shiki!

00:43:48.689 --> 00:43:50.774
Did you take this capsule?

00:43:51.608 --> 00:43:53.736
-The cold medicine?
-No, it's not!

00:43:53.819 --> 00:43:55.362
Oh…

00:43:55.446 --> 00:43:56.613
Did you?

00:43:58.907 --> 00:43:59.742
Huh?

00:44:06.874 --> 00:44:08.625
What?

00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:16.592
I feel like someone is watching me.

00:44:16.675 --> 00:44:19.595
It could be something unidentified.

00:44:19.678 --> 00:44:21.180
Something is interfering.

00:44:21.263 --> 00:44:23.140
The important things are truly important.

00:44:23.223 --> 00:44:24.475
I don't want to lose them.

00:44:24.558 --> 00:44:26.143
Non amare.

00:44:26.226 --> 00:44:28.020
I can't love.
