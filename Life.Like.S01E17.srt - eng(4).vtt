Wait.

Oh?

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.080
Ms. Rose.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.040
You're early today.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.640
Musheng didn't come home all night.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:33.920
I'm worried.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.920
Move aside.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.360
I'll take you to him.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.000
This way.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.080
Musheng.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.200
Musheng!

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.640
Musheng.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.160
You're a lucky man.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.040
Look.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.240
Ms. Rose brought some porridge for you.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.200
Uh…

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.920
Liu,

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:56.520
I made plenty.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:57.880
Why don't you have some too?

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.040
I don't like porridge.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.600
You two enjoy it.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.040
How

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.080
is he?

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.300
Rushed him to the hospital.
He's alive, but still unconscious.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.040
Well, I'm full.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.240
I'll head back now.

00:02:49.425 --> 00:02:50.865
What's going on with you lately?

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.880
You didn't come home last night.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:59.690
Let me lie on your lap.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.120
I was just too tired.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.000
I feel much better.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.040
Let's go home.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.000
How's Tan Fei?

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.720
Still unconscious.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.760
We don't know when he'll wake up.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.320
Keep an eye

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.520
on this matter.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.440
Don't worry, Boss.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.920
I'm more anxious about it than you.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Before he bit his tongue…

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.440
Get out!

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.990
I'll leave you two to it.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.000
Answer me.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.360
Did you give me to that Japanese man?

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:52.840
Don't get angry.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.040
You enjoy

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.200
the chamber's benefits,

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:59.600
so you should be ready

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.360
to give something back when needed.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.400
And if I refuse?

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.040
Listen to me.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.160
If you refuse,

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:21.520
then there's no place for you here.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.840
Think it over.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.480
(Du Hongyue,)

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.100
(you'll get what's coming!)

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.280
Get out!

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.600
Yamamoto caught Tan Fei

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.190
and handed him to Du Hongyue.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.400
Do you think he'll give you up?

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:50.480
He won't.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.040
He bit his tongue

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.440
right in front of me.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.480
He's got guts.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.240
I have to find a way to get him out.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:10.880
I'll help you.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.840
Thank you,

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.080
Xu.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.040
Right.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.640
Last night,

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.400
I saw Yamamoto take Man Li
to the Yangtze Hotel.

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:26.920
You sure?

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:27.840
Of course.

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:29.960
Yamamoto drugged her

00:05:30.453 --> 00:05:31.640
and tried to assault her.

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.840
That scumbag!

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:37.880
Then what happened?

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.680
Hong and I saved her,

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.120
and we left Yamamoto

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.280
a little surprise of our own.

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:46.720
I'm glad it all turned out fine.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.360
I can't believe they'd do that.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.000
What's the matter?

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.320
Feeling sorry for her?

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.160
I…

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:58.920
I'm not.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.400
Man Li

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.920
might be spoiled,

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.080
but she's not a bad person deep down.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.160
Are you

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.960
jealous?

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.600
Yes.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:13.680
I am.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.400
So what?

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.560
You're my man.

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.440
I love seeing you jealous.

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.520
Well,

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.600
you can only love me in this lifetime.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:29.760
Got it,

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:30.920
Zhou Musheng?

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:33.680
Not just this life.

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.280
The next,

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.990
the one after that,
and the one after that,

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:39.680
I'll only love you.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.240
Ms. Rose.
Please make yourself comfortable.

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.280
I'll be done soon.

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:54.320
All right.

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:57.720
All right.

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:58.960
Come back for it in two days.

00:06:59.240 --> 00:06:59.840
All right.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:10.440
Ms. Rose,

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.320
Here to pick up
Mr. Zhou's clothes again?

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:13.240
Yes.

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.520
You're a good girl.

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:18.760
Mr. Zhou

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.200
is a blessed man.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:26.700
Here you go.

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.560
I'll get going, then.

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:46.500
(Tan Fei's injured and in captivity)

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:56.200
How is he?

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:57.560
Badly hurt.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.480
He's still in critical condition.

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:01.680
Do whatever it takes.

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.240
He has to stay alive.

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:04.600
We'll do our best.

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:08.240
Yao.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:09.740
What did the doctor say?

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.160
He said a bunch of stuff I didn't get.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:13.560
But basically, he's done for.

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:15.000
Luo Zhenyao!

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.600
So this is where you've been hiding,
you scum!

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:21.040
- Come with me!
- Wait, Man Li…

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.520
You can talk things through.

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.920
Stay out of this.

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:26.120
Don't you dare follow us!

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:28.600
Wait…

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:29.200
I can explain!

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:30.000
Man Li,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:30.920
let me go!

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:31.840
People are watching!

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:35.280
Did you

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:36.880
spike my drink?

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:40.080
You saw me do it?

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:43.280
Who else

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:45.640
would use such filthy tricks?

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:04.440
You're awake.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.240
I was just following orders.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.280
I had no choice.

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.120
Whose orders?

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:16.320
Du Hongyue's?

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.120
I didn't say that.

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:22.360
Man Li,

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:23.640
you've been

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.840
risking your life for him

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:27.760
for years,

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:29.400
and now

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.200
he sells you out

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.280
to please the Japanese.

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.440
Even I feel sorry

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:35.720
for you.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.360
You think you're any better?

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:44.040
You've been by his side
all these years too.

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.000
Do you see your name

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:47.240
on his right-hand list?

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.280
If he'd betray me,

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.560
he'll betray you

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:54.800
too…

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:57.960
That's why

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.520
we should work together

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:02.440
to maximize our mutual interests.

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:04.360
Tomorrow,

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:05.880
give Luo Zhenyao the note

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:06.960
with my name.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:07.840
Tell them

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:09.600
I'm your contact.

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.040
No.

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:15.440
That's too dangerous for you.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:16.960
Don't worry.

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:18.760
I can handle myself.

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:20.240
Senior…

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:22.280
Take care…

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:23.800
You too.

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:26.880
Whatever you decide,

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:28.360
I'll back you up.

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:31.320
So

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:32.480
that's a yes?

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:34.720
Deal.

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:36.040
Pleasure working with you.

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:37.600
So…

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:39.880
How about drinks at my place tonight?

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:41.200
Get lost.

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:45.920
Hey.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:51.280
You two done fighting?

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.680
Just talk it out.
We're on the same side.

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:55.520
Yeah, yeah, we're all good now.

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:56.480
Just a misunderstanding.

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:57.400
Right, Man Li?

00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.960
Then I'll get going,

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:00.680
Yao.

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:06.000
(They've made up already?)

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:08.200
(Those two are definitely
up to something.)

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:11.920
Pomegranates!
Plump and sweet pomegranates!

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:13.880
Hello, Miss.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.980
Would you like some pomegranates?
They're sweet.

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:17.280
Try one.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:27.640
Yi, have one.

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:28.160
Sure.

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:33.360
Pack a few

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.160
for me.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:34.760
All right.

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:42.200
How much?

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:43.920
Two copper coins.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:46.600
Thank you.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.040
Here you go.

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:51.580
(Night Shanghai)

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:01.800
Man Li.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:02.480
Hey.

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:03.840
Rose.

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:06.160
Were you looking for me?

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:07.200
No.

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.960
I was just passing by.

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:11.280
Oh.

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:12.760
Did you just get off work?

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:14.040
Yes.

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:15.080
I just got off work.

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:16.440
Want

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:17.800
to grab a drink together?

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:19.520
Sure.

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:20.680
I'm free tonight.

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:21.280
All right.

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:22.340
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.400
What are you doing around here?

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:30.360
Just picking up a few things.

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:38.160
Well, if it isn't Night Shanghai's Rose.

00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:39.080
Where are you headed?

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:39.760
Go away.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:40.800
You go away!

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:41.800
Man Li!

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:42.320
Let's have

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:43.320
a drink together.

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:44.240
Let…

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:45.760
Let's not go home until we're drunk…

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:48.800
Get lost.

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:51.600
It's a misunderstanding…

00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:58.240
Are you all right?

00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:59.040
I'm fine.

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:00.340
I didn't scare you, did I?

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:01.580
No.
