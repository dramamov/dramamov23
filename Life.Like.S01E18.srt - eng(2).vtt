- Man Li.
- Rose.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:47.760
You go first.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.160
I still haven't thanked you

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.800
for last time.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.960
You don't need to.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.000
I wish you and Zhou Musheng

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.160
all the best.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.840
If he ever treats you badly,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.520
tell me. I'll set him straight.

00:02:12.472 --> 00:02:13.272
That reminds me.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.840
We're living in turbulent times.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.360
You should be careful
where you're staying at Night Shanghai.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.200
If any sleazy old men bother you,

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.080
just tell them

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.320
you're my sister.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.520
I'll look out for you.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.160
Sister,

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.320
my respects to you.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.080
You're

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.160
too polite.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.840
Man Li,

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.840
don't you like Zhou Musheng anymore?

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.760
Just a man.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.840
We can't let him get between us.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.120
Thank you.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:57.320
So dramatic.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.160
Cheers.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.440
It's too dangerous.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.390
I'm not agreeing to this.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.360
I know Du Hongyue too well.

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:19.560
He's suspicious of everyone.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.260
I have to put myself in the middle of it.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:22.920
I disagree too.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:25.800
Hear me out.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.120
If I do this, first,

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.120
we can

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.320
take down Luo Zhenyao.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.200
He's a real problem

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.920
and will interfere with my mission.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.840
Secondly,

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.360
Du Hongyue needs to go through
a real setback

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.640
before he'll really trust me.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.760
Thirdly,

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.430
I'll need you guys to help me out.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.960
How?

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.800
I need you to use the chaos
to get Tan Fei out.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.000
Don't look like

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.040
I'm walking to my death…

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.680
Don't say that!

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.400
It's bad luck.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.360
Be careful.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.560
You're being too sentimental.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:20.520
Cao,

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.560
while I'm gone,

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.000
take care of Rose for me.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:26.920
I won't.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.700
She's your woman.
Take care of her yourself

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:32.760
when you come back.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:36.800
Take care.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:37.840
Take care.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.080
I'm off.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.240
Back in school,

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.960
Zhou Musheng didn't know

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.680
much of anything.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.440
You're kidding.

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.920
I'm not.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.200
He never told me that.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.520
Guess he was embarrassed.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.990
He doesn't seem like
that kind of person though.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.640
I'll ask him about it later.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.640
Oh, here.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.960
I bought you some pomegranates.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.040
You bought them for me?

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.440
Yes.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.640
That's so sweet of you.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.800
How'd you know I love pomegranates?

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.360
I loved them too when I was little.

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:20.240
See you.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.120
(When she was little?)

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.240
You're the best.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.080
These pomegranates are so sweet.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.640
Don't cry.

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:51.960
I'll buy you more.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.160
I want them…

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.320
I'll get them later.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.400
Pomegranates…

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:58.800
Don't cry.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.200
I'll buy you more later.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:17.440
You're back.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:21.960
What were you doing?

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:23.600
Your face is filthy.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:48.760
Take a look.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.120
I made all of this for you.

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.000
You made all this?

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.320
Try it.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.080
The food looks good.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:08.800
It's delicious.

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.000
I'll try some too.

It's so salty!

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:25.320
Maybe I should

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.840
just take you out instead?

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.800
No, really, I love it.

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:33.960
No man's ever

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:35.880
cooked for me before.

Ms. Xu,

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:16.400
may I

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.440
have this dance?

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.120

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:53.700
(Zhou Musheng)

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:55.920
Zhou Musheng.

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.840
Heavens helped me.

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:04.800
You knew.

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.840
You knew and didn't say anything?

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:10.200
You son of a tramp!

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.000
You almost got me killed!

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:12.960
Killed!

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:14.640
You knew…

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:37.520
Captain Cao.

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:38.480
Let's go.

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.160
How's Zhou?

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.630
We'll talk after we get out of here.

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:07.180
What's going on?

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:10.000
