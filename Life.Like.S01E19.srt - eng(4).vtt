Boss.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.360
Tan Fei

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.320
confessed.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.380
(Zhou Musheng)

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.360
How could it be Zhou Musheng?

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.760
Why couldn't it be Zhou Musheng?

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.120
Boss,

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.040
haven't you always told me that saying?

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.720
You can know a face, but not a heart.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.480
Liu!

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.880
Boss.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.520
Bring Zhou Musheng

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.480
to the interrogation room.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.680
Go on.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.560
Okay.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.680
(Zhou Musheng,)

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.600
(you're finally getting
what's coming to you.)

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.800
What happened to your arm?

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.920
All for the sake of work.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.040
It's a small injury.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.240
Go back and get some rest.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.760
Yes, sir.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.440
I'll get going then, Boss.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.720
Talk!

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.920
Still not talking?

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.160
Answer me!

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.440
You think you're tough?

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.500
Let's see if your mouth is tougher
than my whip.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.960
Answer…

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:50.440
Hold it.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.000
You're my student.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:10.720
You should know

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.200
that the sooner you confess,

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.580
the sooner you'll be free.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.240
Sir,

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.960
I know.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:20.680
But can I

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.040
ask you a few questions?

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.120
Go on.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.000
First of all,

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.240
why did Tan Fei

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.640
suddenly change his attitude?

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:35.760
Second,

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.280
why did he

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.760
only ask to see Captain Luo?

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.520
Third,

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.480
I didn't even know

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.200
Tan Fei had woken up.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.400
Why

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.040
was he rescued

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.640
right after Captain Luo showed up?

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.300
What are you trying to say?

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.600
Those are some good questions.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.040
Boss,

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.360
actually, I thought

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:06.680
the same thing too.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.320
Luo Zhenyao,

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.880
he…

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:12.840
And back when

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.640
Tan Fei tried to kill himself,

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.400
I was right there in the room.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.440
Why didn't he accuse me then,

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.620
but wait until after he tried
to kill himself to point fingers at me?

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.480
Don't you think that's strange?

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.560
You're saying

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.360
Luo Zhenyao staged
the whole thing himself?

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:37.760
Whether

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.480
it's true or not,

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.440
I'll leave that to your judgment.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:59.600
Talk!

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:01.320
Answer me!

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.350
I'll whip it out of you!

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.640
I've got to go away for a while.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.440
Eat on time

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.320
and sleep on time

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:19.480
while I'm away.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.840
Oh?

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.160
Who's got you so distracted?

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.640
You've been out of it all day.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:33.520
It's just…

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.040
the way Zhou Musheng left the other day.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.040
I can't shake the feeling
something was off.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.280
Oh, come on.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.600
Just relax.

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.480
Your man's not running off anywhere.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:52.960
Talk!

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.160
Talk!

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.120
Talk!

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:59.480
Hey.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:01.400
Step out for a minute.

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.920
That Tan Fei finally confessed.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.200
So you two

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.440
were in on it together, huh?

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.480
You came up with the plan,
he played the part,

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.120
and together you dumped the blame on me.

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:31.960
You're the director.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:33.560
He's the actor.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:35.240
What?

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.490
Are you planning to put on a show
at Night Shanghai next?

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:38.580
What are you after?

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.280
Good thing Boss isn't stupid.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.640
If he'd believed you,

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.640
I'd be the one in your place.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.960
You two nearly got me killed.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.240
Right-hand man, my foot.

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.800
You did this to my left arm, didn't you?

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.200
Now I need two people
just to help me put on a glove.

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.240
Two!

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:01.680
Luo Zhenyao,

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.160
you've been waiting for this day

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.440
a long time, haven't you?

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.160
That obvious, huh?

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:14.720
Where's Tan Fei

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:17.840
hiding?

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.680
Have you lost your mind?

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.240
How would I know where he is?

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:26.080
I should be asking you that!

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.200
You want to earn yourself
some credit, right?

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:33.480
Come here.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.120
I'll tell you.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.200
Zhou Musheng!

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:45.440
Let go of me!

00:07:59.280 --> 00:07:59.960
Talk!

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.680
You dog!

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:12.640
Scoundrel!

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:16.680
I'll take care of Rose

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:17.800
for you

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:18.960
from now on.

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:22.160
Luo Zhenyao!

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:24.000
Come at me if you've got the guts!

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:25.520
Don't you touch her!

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.440
I'll kill you!

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:41.480
Oh?

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:44.200
What happened to your ear?

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.000
Got bitten by a dog.

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:46.600
What are you doing here?

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:47.280
Why?

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:49.000
I can't come by?

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:51.400
Come here.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:54.720
You can guard against anyone,

00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:56.160
but not someone from your own house.

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:57.200
What's going on?

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:58.680
We found the mole.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:08:59.920
Who is it?

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.040
Zhou Musheng, duh.

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.120
Who else, me?

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:03.800
It can't be him.

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.560
You never believe me.

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:08.840
Where is he?

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:09.720
Inside.

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:10.920
Hey.

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:12.440
Where are you going?

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:14.200
Listen to me.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.240
No one sees him

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.200
without my permission.

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:20.120
Don't tell me you still like him?

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.320
Of course not.

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.320
Looks like
it all worked out in your favor.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:25.600
One less obstacle in your way.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:26.360
Right.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:27.760
With your looks,

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:28.920
you can have any man you want.

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:31.720
Don't forget our deal.

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:34.180
I need to get my ear checked.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:35.440
It's killing me.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000
See you around, Yao.

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:58.400
(Luo Zhenyao definitely)

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.680
(wants Zhou Musheng dead.)

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.640
(Should I tell Xu about this?)

00:10:21.748 --> 00:10:22.160
Oh.

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:24.040
If it isn't Ms. Man Li.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:24.680
Hong.

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.100
Why aren't you going in?

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:27.480
I'm here to see Rose.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:28.720
Is she around?

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:29.920
Yes.

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:30.990
She's in the dressing room.

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:32.040
I'll take you to her.

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:32.560
Thank you.

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.320
Rose.

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:37.160
Yes?

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:39.360
Man Li's here.

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:41.680
Man Li.

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:42.520
What brings you here?

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:46.120
Ms. Man Li.

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:47.600
I've got something to do.

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:48.500
I'll let you two talk.

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:48.960
Mm.

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.120
Call me if you need anything.

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:52.600
What's wrong?

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:53.890
What brings you here so suddenly?

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:54.480
It's…

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:56.440
Zhou Musheng.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.720
Du Hongyue suspects him
of being the mole.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.080
They've locked him up.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:01.520
What?

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:07.520
He can't be locked up.

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:09.880
He told me he was going
out of town for business.

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:12.320
Calm down.

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:13.840
Word is,

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:16.600
it's got something to do
with that student, Tan Fei.

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:49.120
Man Li.

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:52.360
Help me.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:56.440
I must see him.

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:01.600
I'll find a way.

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.120
I have to see him.

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:08.480
You'll see him.
