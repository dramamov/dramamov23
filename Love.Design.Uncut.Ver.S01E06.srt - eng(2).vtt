This is Khun Rain’s house.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.600
You know our companies are rivals.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.000
If we had our own home—

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.966
—we wouldn’t have to keep doubting each other like this.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.433
You and Vee want a house, don’t you?

00:00:32.433 --> 00:00:34.833
I want you to report every move Jinta makes.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.566
What am I to you, really?

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.033
Just a boss and her employee?

00:00:38.033 --> 00:00:40.766
What else could we possibly be?

00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:42.466
- Hey!
- Oh!

00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:44.066
Don’t take advantage of her!

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.900
I’ve got an idea for Khun Rain’s house.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.433
We don’t need to stay in this house anymore.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.733
But you know, right?

00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:06.400
That I still love you.

00:01:34.833 --> 00:01:36.066
I love you, sis.

00:01:42.666 --> 00:01:44.566
Can we try being together?

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.500
For real this time—
No more pretending to be lovers.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.500
I mean it.

00:02:53.833 --> 00:02:55.566
Let’s give it a try… let’s be together.

You said it, sis. You said we’re dating now.

No changing your mind.

from that old auntie, right?

Hey—

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:38.866
Sis!—

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.133
Okay…

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.933
Silence is your answer then.

Coming to your house this time…

00:06:05.333 --> 00:06:08.400
…feels kind of different, doesn’t it?

00:06:14.033 --> 00:06:16.433
You’re blushing too, right, Sis?

00:06:18.833 --> 00:06:20.433
I’m not blushing.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.133
What are you even thinking?

00:06:24.066 --> 00:06:26.833
You wanna know what I’m thinking about?

00:06:41.233 --> 00:06:42.733

00:06:44.766 --> 00:06:48.666
Well, with a mood like this…
who wouldn’t think something naughty?

Pervert.

00:06:50.966 --> 00:06:54.000
But I only get naughty with you, sis.

00:06:54.166 --> 00:06:54.966
Hey!

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.466
Enough. Go take a shower—Cool your head.

00:06:57.833 --> 00:06:58.833
Mmm…

00:06:58.933 --> 00:07:04.000
- So after I shower… what should we do next?
- Ugh.

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.133
Stop. Enough.

00:07:06.133 --> 00:07:08.466
Quit teasing me already. Go! Go!

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.966
Fine, I’ll go shower…
we’ll continue later, okay?

00:07:18.633 --> 00:07:20.033

00:07:22.166 --> 00:07:23.300
Not yet.

I like...

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:56.200
the way you are, sis.

00:07:56.633 --> 00:07:58.333
And most importantly…

00:07:59.266 --> 00:08:00.700
You’re really beautiful.

00:08:20.133 --> 00:08:21.700
That smile—what does it mean?

00:08:23.166 --> 00:08:24.366
You figure it out yourself.

00:08:24.433 --> 00:08:25.833

00:16:59.166 --> 00:17:00.766
So where exactly is the problem?

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:03.033
Just tell me straight —
so I can help fix it properly.

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:08.333
If I’m being honest…

00:17:09.266 --> 00:17:11.466
I haven’t been able to give this project my full time.

00:17:11.866 --> 00:17:13.833
I’m also responsible for the resort project.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.233
And that one’s having some serious issues right now too.

00:17:23.466 --> 00:17:25.066
Mind, can I talk to you for a minute?

00:17:25.266 --> 00:17:26.766
Vee, give us the room.

00:17:42.566 --> 00:17:44.066
You look stressed.

00:17:44.566 --> 00:17:46.200
Is Vee’s project causing trouble?

00:17:48.133 --> 00:17:50.700
Let’s just say… it’s not quite what I wanted.

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:54.233
Good, I actually wanted to talk about that.

00:17:54.866 --> 00:17:57.933
I want you to change the team in charge of Khun Rain’s project.

00:17:59.266 --> 00:18:00.800
Why change the team?

00:18:01.933 --> 00:18:04.533
Since Vee’s team couldn’t deliver what we needed—

00:18:04.566 --> 00:18:06.900
—we’ll assign it to a team that can.

00:18:07.233 --> 00:18:08.466
But… will it be on time?

00:18:08.566 --> 00:18:11.933
Switching suddenly like this—
can the new team really handle it?

00:18:14.366 --> 00:18:15.866
The new team’s work...

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.133
I’ve already drafted the main framework.

00:18:21.633 --> 00:18:23.166
This actually a good idea.

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:24.833
From what I’ve heard—

00:18:24.833 --> 00:18:27.066
—Khun Rain and Khun Ming both like Japanese style anyway.

00:18:27.066 --> 00:18:31.466
If I refine the details a bit, I think it’ll turn out great.

00:18:34.733 --> 00:18:36.166
And…

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:39.533
When exactly did this “new team” start working on it?

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:42.833
That’s not important. Let’s just say—

00:18:42.933 --> 00:18:45.400
—you’ll be changing the team handling Khun Rain's project, right?

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:56.700
I’m counting on you to finish it, Mind.

00:19:26.033 --> 00:19:27.233
Vee,

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:30.333
From now on you don’t need to handle Khun Rain's project anymore.

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:32.966
But Mind asked that you keep following it for a while—

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:34.600
—once everything’s in order,

00:19:34.666 --> 00:19:35.766
Just hand over all the files.

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:38.133
Then go back to fully focus on the resort project.

00:19:41.066 --> 00:19:42.733
Did I not do well enough?

00:19:43.166 --> 00:19:44.766
Is that why you’re removing me?

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:45.833
Not that.

00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:48.166
Mind just wants you to focus on the resort project.

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:50.400
I already have another team continuing the house project.

00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:54.100
Hey, don’t overthink it —

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:55.366
You did well.

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:31.633
Tertis, want to go home together?

00:20:31.766 --> 00:20:33.400
It’s okay, I already have plans with a friend.

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:34.700
I’ll go ahead then.

00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:47.066
I’m here.

00:20:58.866 --> 00:21:00.233
Is something wrong?

00:21:02.466 --> 00:21:04.466
I don’t have to handle Khun Rain’s project anymore.

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:07.100
Just the first phase.

00:21:09.166 --> 00:21:11.600
After that, I’ll go back to the resort project as usual.

00:21:12.933 --> 00:21:13.800
Really?

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:14.833
Yeah.

00:21:16.633 --> 00:21:18.200
But who knows—

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:20.466
—they might call me back again.

00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:24.066
Anyway, at least I feel relieved now.

00:21:32.466 --> 00:21:34.033
Aren’t you happy for me?

00:21:38.166 --> 00:21:39.400
Of course I am.

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:44.200
I’m happy that you get to do the work you really want.

00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:24.100
- Shit!
- Shit!

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:49.533
P’Yong.

00:22:49.566 --> 00:22:51.800
Why’d you bring us to a hotpot place?

00:22:51.966 --> 00:22:53.366
Add the cabbage first.

00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:56.833
Now.

00:22:57.033 --> 00:22:58.166
Talk.

00:22:58.300 --> 00:22:59.833
You’d better have an explanation for this.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.500
Are you my dad now?

00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:04.600
Okay, then I’ll just tell everyone at the office.

00:23:05.466 --> 00:23:06.700
Fine, I’ll tell you.

00:23:08.033 --> 00:23:09.733
Go on. Talk.

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:18.766
Me and P’Vee...

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:20.533
We’ve been together for years now.

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:23.966
Since I first joined Jinta...

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:32.266
We met at—

00:23:35.233 --> 00:23:37.066
I know, Mom. You’re worried.

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:39.133
But I’m here.

00:23:39.566 --> 00:23:42.266
You know I’m scared of needles.

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:45.566
I’m not lying—
want me to send you a picture?

00:23:45.733 --> 00:23:49.066
Okay, okay—
I’ll call you back once it’s done.

00:23:49.733 --> 00:23:51.500
Yes, bye Mom.

00:24:00.833 --> 00:24:02.066
You’re scared of needles?

00:24:20.866 --> 00:24:23.400
You’re Ms. Waleerat Tangkitmun, right?

00:24:24.633 --> 00:24:25.933
Oh, yes.

00:24:27.366 --> 00:24:28.966
Let me explain—

00:24:28.966 --> 00:24:31.700
a bit about the HPV vaccine.

00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:36.333
After the shot,

00:24:36.333 --> 00:24:39.866
You might feel mild soreness at the injection site—
but it’ll go away quickly.

00:24:39.866 --> 00:24:42.500
Just like any regular vaccine.

00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:45.600
I can confirm that.

00:24:47.066 --> 00:24:51.300
This vaccine helps prevent cervical cancer —

00:24:51.333 --> 00:24:53.766
Caused by the HPV virus.

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:56.533
It can be transmitted easily through sexual contact.

00:24:56.533 --> 00:24:59.933
Because we never really know if we—

00:24:59.933 --> 00:25:02.666
or our partner might carry HPV.

00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:05.200
And if you don’t have a partner yet—

00:25:07.566 --> 00:25:08.633
—even better.

00:25:08.633 --> 00:25:12.866
It’ll reduce the risk for both you

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:15.000
and your future partner.

00:25:15.033 --> 00:25:17.400
The HPV vaccine—

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:19.600
requires three doses in total.

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:22.866
Once completed, you won’t need any booster shots.

00:25:23.366 --> 00:25:24.166
Okay.

00:25:24.366 --> 00:25:26.966
Please wait here until we call your name.

00:25:30.766 --> 00:25:31.500
Sis.

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:33.600
It doesn’t hurt.

00:25:34.333 --> 00:25:35.300
Just a tiny pinch.

00:25:46.966 --> 00:25:50.466
We started dating without even knowing we worked for rival companies.

00:25:51.633 --> 00:25:54.300
We just knew we were in the same line of work.

00:25:54.633 --> 00:25:56.100
That’s why we clicked so easily.

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:26.866
Did you wait long?

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:28.300
P’Vee.

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:30.333
Not at all, Tertis.

00:26:30.766 --> 00:26:32.300
I just got here.

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:35.433
Because I know Khun Pad and Khun Chan

00:26:35.433 --> 00:26:37.566
can’t stand P'Vee company.

00:26:37.966 --> 00:26:39.800
So I had to keep it a secret.

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:43.300
I didn’t want our relationship...

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:45.733
...to cause problems for either of us.

00:26:47.566 --> 00:26:49.200
Same goes for P’Vee.

00:26:54.766 --> 00:26:56.300
And you think that won’t cause problems?

00:26:57.300 --> 00:26:58.733
Both of you...

00:26:58.733 --> 00:27:00.900
...are literally competing for the same pitch.

00:27:01.566 --> 00:27:03.300
You don’t have to worry about that, Khun Yong.

00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:05.366
I’m no longer in charge of that project.

00:27:05.566 --> 00:27:06.566
I can promise you that.

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:07.666
Khun Vee…

00:27:07.766 --> 00:27:09.633
...how can I be sure of that?

00:27:10.266 --> 00:27:11.700
P’Vee wouldn’t lie, P’Yong.

00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:13.900
She's your girlfriend—
of course you’d take her side.

00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:16.400
It’s not taking sides. It’s called trust.

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:23.133
That’s love, isn't it?

00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:25.633
You’ll do anything for the person you love.

00:27:28.466 --> 00:27:30.166
Or have you never been in love, P’Yong?

00:27:33.333 --> 00:27:34.300
I had.

00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:44.400
I’ve been through something like that too.

00:27:46.433 --> 00:27:48.866
I once matched with the daughter of my mom’s rival restaurant owner on Tinder.

00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:51.366
But in the end…

00:27:53.533 --> 00:27:54.666
…we had to break up.

00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:56.400
Even though we still loved each other.

00:27:57.266 --> 00:28:00.166
We were both afraid of stealing each other’s family recipes.

00:28:00.466 --> 00:28:02.466
Afraid our families’ businesses would fall apart.

00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:04.500
So, we end up breaking up.

00:28:06.033 --> 00:28:07.866
Even though we planned to get married…

00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:09.033
Have kids…

00:28:09.366 --> 00:28:10.466
…and build a family together.

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:14.833
Damn it…

00:28:32.666 --> 00:28:33.866
Let’s eat.

00:28:40.966 --> 00:28:42.166
Do you wanna have some?

00:28:43.866 --> 00:28:45.033
Sure, let me eat.

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:53.633
You two doing okay?

00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:55.366
We’re okay.

00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:04.233
Hello everyone.

00:29:04.266 --> 00:29:05.900
I’m Rin from Jinta Architects.

00:29:06.233 --> 00:29:09.466
Based on the concept “Love Makes a Home”
from Khun Rain and Khun Ming—

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:12.800
—we’ve developed and reinterpreted it into a new concept called—

00:29:12.966 --> 00:29:14.933
Love–Life Balance.

00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:17.900
A love that harmonizes perfectly with everyday life.

00:29:18.233 --> 00:29:19.700
A love that—

00:29:22.133 --> 00:29:23.166
What was that again, sis?

00:29:24.933 --> 00:29:26.766
Are you a goldfish or what?

00:29:26.866 --> 00:29:28.533
It’s such a short script and you can’t memorize it?

00:29:28.533 --> 00:29:29.800
Short?

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:32.400
It’s super long! No one can remember that!

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:33.400
Why don’t you say it yourself?

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:34.733
It’s that long!

00:29:34.866 --> 00:29:37.400
Come on, sis! Can’t you just do the talking? Or someone else, maybe?

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:39.566
I really can’t remember it—it’s too long!

00:29:39.666 --> 00:29:41.333
You’re the one who designed it.

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:43.633
You know this project better than anyone.

00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:45.600
It’s only right that you’re the one presenting.

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:47.100
It’s your work.

00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:48.766
It’s our work.

00:29:48.866 --> 00:29:50.166
Sis, present for me instead? Please?

00:29:50.166 --> 00:29:51.866
Have a little confidence in yourself.

00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:53.200
You can do this. I know you can.

00:29:55.866 --> 00:29:58.666
Hmm… then before I present—

00:29:58.666 --> 00:29:59.966
You have to…

00:29:59.966 --> 00:30:04.333
Give me a big kiss first—
for good luck.

00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:08.033
Have I ever told you—

00:30:08.066 --> 00:30:09.533
—that I love your smile?

00:30:10.366 --> 00:30:11.366
Why’s that?

00:30:12.766 --> 00:30:14.533
Well, usually you look…

00:30:14.533 --> 00:30:17.600
…serious, strict—
kinda scary.

00:30:21.833 --> 00:30:24.166
So I just want you to smile more.

00:30:24.366 --> 00:30:26.066
I want to see you happy.

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:30.566
You little…

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:33.500
This kid right here—

00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:35.833
—is grown up enough to love you now.

00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:38.600
That’s so cheesy.

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:40.166
Ew.

00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:44.133
Cheers me upppp, I’m nervous.

00:30:44.166 --> 00:30:46.500
– Hey, you’ve got this.
– My tongue’s twisting already!

00:31:01.166 --> 00:31:03.166
- Hello.
- Hello, Khun Rain, Khun Ming.

00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:05.200
Please, give it your best today.

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:06.566
I’m looking forward to seeing your presentation.

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:07.500
Thank you very much.

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:09.300
- Hope you’ll like it.
- I’m sure I will.

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:11.100
- It should be great.
- I really love the idea already.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:13.933
Oh — Khun Parat!

00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:15.366
- Good to see you, Khun Parat.
- Likewise.

00:31:15.366 --> 00:31:17.466
- Hello again.
- This is Khun Thee and Khun Mind.

00:31:17.466 --> 00:31:18.700
And this is Khun Parat.

00:31:18.733 --> 00:31:21.200
He’ll also be joining to see the pitching today.

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:22.733
- Thank you very much.
- My pleasure.

00:31:23.066 --> 00:31:24.433
It’s an honor.

00:31:24.433 --> 00:31:26.000
The traffic’s quite bad today.

00:31:26.033 --> 00:31:27.833
Just a little, yeah.

00:31:37.166 --> 00:31:38.200
I'm nervous, sis.

00:32:24.533 --> 00:32:25.933
For today’s pitch, I hope—

00:32:25.966 --> 00:32:28.000
—you’re ready to accept defeat.

00:32:50.766 --> 00:32:52.000
Everything all set.

00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:57.366
How’s it looking? Everything ready?

00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:58.533
Yes, all ready, P'Mind.

00:33:05.733 --> 00:33:06.866
Give it your all.

00:33:16.033 --> 00:33:18.233
Wonder what tricks Thee’s team has up their sleeve.

00:33:19.766 --> 00:33:20.833
Either way — we’re going to win.

00:33:21.333 --> 00:33:22.366
Don’t be afraid of them. Let’s go.

00:33:25.066 --> 00:33:26.033
Greeting

00:33:26.133 --> 00:33:28.733
I’m Mind, an architect from Mind Space.

00:33:28.933 --> 00:33:31.733
Today, I’ll be presenting our single-house renovation project.

00:33:31.766 --> 00:33:34.300
It’s one of the projects we’re most proud of.

00:33:34.433 --> 00:33:36.333
Our concept today is —

00:33:37.733 --> 00:33:39.233
Love Life Balance.

00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:41.033
A life in perfect harmony with love —

00:33:41.066 --> 00:33:43.300
— and with the rhythm of living together.

00:33:51.566 --> 00:33:54.866
We believe a balanced relationship begins with respecting each other’s space.

00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:56.533
And honoring each other’s individuality.

00:33:57.333 --> 00:33:58.833
Our team has designed—

00:33:58.833 --> 00:34:02.733
—a home that truly reflects Khun Rain and Khun Ming’s lifestyle.

00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:05.433
We focused on comfort,

00:34:05.833 --> 00:34:09.633
modernity, and harmony between both of your tastes.

00:34:09.633 --> 00:34:12.433
And we also learned that—

00:34:12.666 --> 00:34:17.133
—both of you share beautiful memories from Japan.

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:18.500
Wow!

00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:20.266
How did you find that out?

00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:21.700
That’s impressive.

00:34:21.933 --> 00:34:23.066
Absolutely amazing!

00:34:33.333 --> 00:34:34.533
Khun Aokbab!

00:34:35.066 --> 00:34:35.966
Khun Aokbab!!

00:34:36.166 --> 00:34:37.200
Look at this!

00:34:46.666 --> 00:34:48.400
This is our design!

00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:50.333
It’s the same floor plan!

00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:52.366
- Lemme see!
- What the—?!

00:34:52.433 --> 00:34:54.600
How the hell did that woman get our design?!

00:35:01.566 --> 00:35:02.666
That’s incredible.

00:35:03.366 --> 00:35:04.466
Thank you so much.

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:07.700
Sis—

00:35:07.933 --> 00:35:09.466
Even the interior is exactly the same!

00:35:09.766 --> 00:35:10.833
This isn’t right…

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.733
- Let me see!
- Show me!

00:35:14.566 --> 00:35:16.333
They totally copied us!

00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:23.066
- I’ll deal with her myself— she’s next door, right?!
- Whoa whoa, Rin! Calm down!

00:35:23.066 --> 00:35:26.066
- Let me go!
- Rin, sit down! Calm down, Rin!

00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:28.166
- Sis!
- Hey! Aokbab!

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:33.700
P'Mind…

00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:39.033
You are doing this again?

00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:42.100
What do you mean?

00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:43.633
You copied my work!

00:35:48.333 --> 00:35:49.333
Copied your work?

00:35:49.933 --> 00:35:52.133
From the concept title to the details—
it’s identical!

00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:53.900
And you’re saying it’s not copied?

00:35:54.766 --> 00:35:56.800
You haven’t changed at all since ten years ago.

00:36:03.333 --> 00:36:04.766
This is my company —

00:36:04.966 --> 00:36:06.866
— and I won’t let you destroy it.

00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:32.366
Come here. We’re clearing this up right now.

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:34.733
You gave our work to your girlfriend, didn’t you?!

00:36:34.866 --> 00:36:36.433
Are you crazy? I didn’t do that!

00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:39.433
Then how did they end up with our design?!

00:36:39.566 --> 00:36:40.400
I don’t know either!

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:42.666
Who sent those files? How’d you get them?!

00:36:42.666 --> 00:36:43.466
Yong!

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:45.100
Chill, man.

00:36:47.266 --> 00:36:48.000
Tertis.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.666
Go wait somewhere else — I’ll handle this.

00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:52.266
No, Tertis, stay right here!

00:36:54.333 --> 00:36:55.366
Yong!

00:37:00.666 --> 00:37:01.933
Listen to me.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:03.866
Right now…

00:37:04.233 --> 00:37:06.266
We fix this pitching mess first.

00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:07.366
You got that?

00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:10.633
- But Tertis—
- I asked, did you got that?!

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.133
…Yeah, I understand.

00:37:16.033 --> 00:37:17.033
Calm down.

00:37:17.466 --> 00:37:19.166
Everyone’s trying to fix this together.

00:37:23.133 --> 00:37:24.366
Ugh…

00:37:38.366 --> 00:37:39.366
Sis…

00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:44.500
Right now…

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.400
I feel just like…

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:49.500
…the day I found out she submitted my work as her own.

00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:17.900
It’s okay.

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:20.800
You’re not fighting alone anymore.

00:38:21.033 --> 00:38:22.700
You’ve got me right here.

00:38:24.733 --> 00:38:26.866
Why be scared of that old witch anyway?

00:38:27.066 --> 00:38:28.866
If I see her, I’ll punch her for you!

00:38:28.966 --> 00:38:30.333
Knock her out cold!

00:38:33.466 --> 00:38:34.566
Don’t cry anymore.

00:38:34.866 --> 00:38:36.400
…Thanks, Rin.

00:38:39.166 --> 00:38:41.133
Don’t cry, okay—hm.

00:38:41.633 --> 00:38:44.333
You can cry if you want to—
but only cry with me, okay?

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:50.600
If you need to cry, just let it all out.

00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:01.000
You’re the strongest, you know that, sis?

00:39:18.866 --> 00:39:20.766
We need to redo the pitching now.

00:39:22.433 --> 00:39:23.566
Right now?

00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:24.666
Mm-hm.

00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:26.833
How are we gonna do that, sis?

00:39:29.333 --> 00:39:31.833
I’ve got another house model I designed before.

00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:33.533
If everyone helps,

00:39:33.766 --> 00:39:34.800
and we do it together now,

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.000
we might still make it in time for the afternoon pitch.

00:39:38.333 --> 00:39:39.900
When did you even design that?

00:39:40.433 --> 00:39:41.500
I’ll explain later.

00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:43.833
For now, go gather everyone and meet me in the meeting room.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.866
We’ll need everyone’s help on this one.

00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:51.466
If we want to win,

00:39:51.633 --> 00:39:53.466
we’re racing against time.

00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:26.066
- Aokbab!
- Everyone, we’re changing the house design.

00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:28.200
We’ll use the version I personally designed.

00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:29.200
But will it be done in time?

00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:31.000
I’ve already done most of it—
it just needs finishing touches.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.766
If we all work together, we’ll make it.

00:40:32.766 --> 00:40:34.466
- Check the 3D rendering for me.
- Got it.

00:40:34.833 --> 00:40:36.433
Rin, handle the interior design.

00:40:36.466 --> 00:40:38.700
- Tertis, prepare the presentation slides.
- Okay!

00:40:39.133 --> 00:40:41.600
- P'Chan, double-check the overall concept.
- Got it.

00:40:41.633 --> 00:40:43.633
- P'Pad, handle Khun Rain and Khun Ming for me.

00:40:43.666 --> 00:40:44.566
I just need more time.

00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:46.033
- Okay.
- Let’s go.

00:40:46.966 --> 00:40:48.266
- You help me find some ref!

00:40:49.766 --> 00:40:52.800
Khun Ming, Khun Rain — it’s time for Jinta’s presentation.

00:40:53.466 --> 00:40:56.900
Alright. Khun Phalat, please excuse us—
make yourself comfortable.

00:40:56.900 --> 00:40:59.233
- I’ll come in shortly.
- Sure.

00:40:59.233 --> 00:41:01.166
- This way, please.

00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:07.900
- Khun Ming, Khun Rain—
Excuse me.

00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:10.866
Our presentation device’s having a small issue.

00:41:10.866 --> 00:41:13.666
Could we please delay for about thirty minutes?

00:41:13.666 --> 00:41:15.933
- Of course, no problem.
Thank you very much.

00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:24.166
- This looks good.
- Nice.

00:41:27.833 --> 00:41:29.233
- This piece, right?

00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:37.166
- You think we’ll make it, P'Chan?
- We will. We have to.

00:41:37.166 --> 00:41:38.466
We’ve got thirty minutes.

00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:40.666
What? Only thirty minutes?!

00:41:40.966 --> 00:41:44.266
You wanna do the pitch or not, huh?
Time’s short — move it!

00:41:44.266 --> 00:41:46.266
Rin, you think we can make it?

00:41:46.766 --> 00:41:47.900
Don’t worry.

00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:50.700
Master Rin always delivers on time.

00:41:54.066 --> 00:41:55.166
You sure this’ll work?

00:41:55.266 --> 00:41:58.166
Hurry up!
Yeah, yeah — this one’s good.

00:41:58.266 --> 00:41:59.633
Let’s go with this one.

00:42:12.366 --> 00:42:14.900
Has anyone here ever experienced love at first sight?

00:42:17.166 --> 00:42:18.800
A pure kind of love…

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:21.366
Filled with beautiful memories.

00:42:22.233 --> 00:42:24.833
Not romantic love,

00:42:25.266 --> 00:42:28.966
but the unconditional love of family.

00:42:36.033 --> 00:42:37.766
Our concept, Love at First Sight,

00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:40.800
is inspired by Khun Ming and her grandmother—

00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:44.000
by the memories they shared

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.566
in this very home.

00:42:47.033 --> 00:42:48.733
That’s why—

00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:52.800
we’ve preserved as much of the house’s original structure as possible,

00:42:52.833 --> 00:42:54.366
to honor those memories.

00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:57.166
For the exterior,

00:42:57.166 --> 00:42:59.266
we’ve emphasized a natural harmony.

00:42:59.266 --> 00:43:02.066
Large trees embrace the house with shade,

00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:05.100
surrounded by small gardens.

00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:07.333
Because as we’ve learned, Khun Ming’s grandmother

00:43:07.366 --> 00:43:10.166
loved growing her own plants and vegetables.

00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:14.433
For the interior—

00:43:14.466 --> 00:43:16.966
we’ve designed it with a sense of warmth,

00:43:16.966 --> 00:43:19.066
both in tone and functionality.

00:43:19.066 --> 00:43:22.366
The furniture and built-ins use natural wood materials,

00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:25.000
giving a subtle touch of Thai essence.

00:43:25.166 --> 00:43:27.100
We bring life into the space

00:43:27.133 --> 00:43:29.733
with indoor trees placed thoughtfully throughout the home.

00:43:30.266 --> 00:43:32.866
So that every time you step inside,

00:43:34.766 --> 00:43:36.733
you feel as if—

00:43:36.733 --> 00:43:39.233
you’re close to your grandmother once again.

00:43:47.766 --> 00:43:50.500
We don’t want this house to be just a house—

00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:52.866
but a place of comfort and belonging.

00:43:53.633 --> 00:43:55.333
A place to return to—

00:43:55.333 --> 00:43:57.966
where we remember those we love, and who love us.

00:43:58.633 --> 00:44:00.833
That is the heart of this home.

00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:03.900
Beautiful.

00:44:04.233 --> 00:44:05.733
That is fabulous

00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:27.666
Both designs are beautiful.

00:44:27.666 --> 00:44:29.366
- Yes.
- Yeah.

00:44:30.066 --> 00:44:32.266
So, which one will you choose?

00:44:32.766 --> 00:44:34.933
Let’s choose together, baby.

00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:37.700
- Help me decide, baby.
- Hmm?

00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:40.966
Whichever one you love… I love too.

00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:49.033
Because the home I want to live in—

00:44:49.266 --> 00:44:50.966
is the one you love.

00:44:51.866 --> 00:44:53.533
It’s our memory.

00:44:55.633 --> 00:45:00.933
Our team designed a home that perfectly fits
Khun Rain and Khun Ming’s lifestyle.

00:45:01.166 --> 00:45:04.100
We also learned that—

00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:08.400
both of you share wonderful memories in Japan.

00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:10.333
The concept Love at First Sight—

00:45:10.333 --> 00:45:12.733
was inspired by Khun Ming and her grandmother.

00:45:12.933 --> 00:45:14.833
That’s why—

00:45:14.866 --> 00:45:18.733
we preserved the original structure of the house.

00:45:18.733 --> 00:45:20.266
As much as possible.

00:45:26.533 --> 00:45:28.233
Then… I’ll be the one to choose.

00:45:28.433 --> 00:45:30.366
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

00:45:30.466 --> 00:45:31.766
I’ll let you decide.

00:45:32.033 --> 00:45:34.300
- It’s our memory, right?
- Yes.

00:45:42.066 --> 00:45:42.866
First of all—

00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:47.500
I’d like to thank both teams deeply for your passion and effort.

00:45:47.633 --> 00:45:51.200
You’ve worked hard to make our dream come true.

00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:54.466
I must say—your ideas,

00:45:54.466 --> 00:45:56.633
are absolutely outstanding.

00:45:57.366 --> 00:46:04.400
I believe everyone’s wondering Which company’s design we fell in love with.

00:46:10.533 --> 00:46:14.866
So the company that gets to renovate our home—

00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:16.866
is...

00:46:33.966 --> 00:46:36.333
Mind Space.

00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:41.500
Congratulations.

00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:43.433
Thank you so much.

00:46:43.533 --> 00:46:45.166
We’ll do our very best.

00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:47.766
You did great.

00:46:59.266 --> 00:47:01.966
See? I told you—
our team would win.

00:47:03.166 --> 00:47:04.400
- Vee.
- Yes?

00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:06.500
Call the restaurant — tell them we’re on our way.

00:47:06.666 --> 00:47:07.866
Sure, Khun Thee.

00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:09.300
P'Thee—

00:47:09.633 --> 00:47:10.433
Hmm?

00:47:14.233 --> 00:47:15.300
Can we talk?

00:47:16.366 --> 00:47:17.866
Not now, Mind.

00:47:18.833 --> 00:47:19.833
We’ll talk later.

00:47:20.366 --> 00:47:21.566
Vee, go ahead, make the call.

00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:38.866
Everything we did went to waste—
because of that damn Thee.

00:47:38.933 --> 00:47:40.466
Anyone know a good hitman?

00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:42.033
Just one clean shot, I’ll pay!

00:47:42.100 --> 00:47:43.333
And you got money for that?

00:47:43.366 --> 00:47:44.400
Nah, broke as hell.

00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:46.666
But I’ve got enough for drinks. Let’s go drown this loss.

00:47:47.133 --> 00:47:49.400
Excuse me, Khun Aokbab—
just a moment please.

00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:53.233
Is something the matter, Khun Ming?

00:47:53.866 --> 00:47:55.633
There’s someone who wants to meet you.

00:47:55.900 --> 00:47:58.966
This is Khun Parat—
a close friend of Rain and me.

00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:00.500
Hello.
Hello. Nice to meet you

00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:01.166
Hello.

00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:04.300
This is Khun Parat, owner of The Arasite hotel group.

00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:06.166
The Arasite…

00:48:06.766 --> 00:48:09.466
The luxury riverside hotel by the Chao Phraya river, right?

00:48:09.900 --> 00:48:10.933
That’s correct.

00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:13.133
I just wanted to say—
I really admire your work.

00:48:13.166 --> 00:48:15.100
Your design impressed me deeply.

00:48:15.433 --> 00:48:16.266
So I wanted to ask—

00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:19.066
Would you be interested in pitching for our new hotel project?

00:48:21.366 --> 00:48:23.733
So you mean, Khun Parat wants us to—

00:48:23.733 --> 00:48:25.433
pitch against other firms again?

00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:30.500
Well… yes, about ten other companies.

00:48:30.633 --> 00:48:32.600
But I’m afraid the timeline might be—

00:48:32.633 --> 00:48:34.866
a bit tight for your team.

00:48:35.233 --> 00:48:37.366
I’m not sure if you’d still be interested.

00:48:38.466 --> 00:48:41.133
Oh—
and Mind Space will be joining too.

00:48:57.566 --> 00:48:59.200
Yes. We’re interested.

00:48:59.466 --> 00:49:00.733
Jinta Architects—

00:49:00.733 --> 00:49:02.633
will join this pitch.

00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:05.900
Excellent.

00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:07.766
As for the project details—

00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:09.400
we’ll discuss later.

00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:13.933
Do your best, okay?
I’ll be secretly cheering you on.

00:49:14.066 --> 00:49:15.033
You can do it!

00:49:15.033 --> 00:49:15.900
- Thank you so much.

00:49:26.500 --> 00:49:28.400
Let’s give it one more try.

00:49:28.633 --> 00:49:29.800
This time—

00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:31.900
we’ll beat Mind Space, together.

00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:36.500
- Let’s go!
- Yeah.

00:49:41.900 --> 00:49:42.800
P’Thee.

00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:43.700
Hm?

00:49:44.300 --> 00:49:45.700
Will you finally talk to me now?

00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:50.800
That project you made me take over—

00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:53.300
It was Jinta Architect’s design, wasn’t it?

00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:58.300
It’s our team’s work now.

00:50:01.133 --> 00:50:02.233
But…

00:50:02.266 --> 00:50:05.166
I know you don’t like those siblings—

00:50:05.333 --> 00:50:07.000
but did it really have to go this far?

00:50:07.300 --> 00:50:08.233
Mind…

00:50:08.966 --> 00:50:10.766
We beat them today, Mind.

00:50:11.233 --> 00:50:13.333
It’s a win for our company.

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.333
Because you made it perfect.

00:50:17.666 --> 00:50:19.966
From now on, we’ll have steady projects from Khun Rain’s side.

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:21.400
Aren’t you happy?

00:51:01.466 --> 00:51:02.766
Sis, are you okay?

00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:05.400
I’m okay.

00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:13.766
If you’re not okay—

00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:15.866
you can say you’re not, you know.

00:51:16.466 --> 00:51:17.900
I’m here to listen.

00:51:22.966 --> 00:51:24.300
Thanks, Rin.

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:27.700
Just… got a lot on my mind.

00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:30.133
About Mind Space…

00:51:31.366 --> 00:51:33.466
and the new hotel project from Khun Parat.

00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:49.566
Since we’re both free today—

00:51:50.533 --> 00:51:51.633
how about we go somewhere?

00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:53.800
Go where?

00:51:55.100 --> 00:51:56.366
To your place, of course.

00:51:57.400 --> 00:51:58.933
My place? Really?

00:51:59.300 --> 00:52:01.700
Why? There’s nothing to eat there.

00:52:02.133 --> 00:52:03.433
We can order delivery.

00:52:04.033 --> 00:52:05.400
I already know what I want to eat.

00:52:21.533 --> 00:52:23.300
So this is what you meant when you said you were hungry?

00:52:24.666 --> 00:52:26.200
Well, yeah!

00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:30.100
What were you thinking, huh?

00:52:40.633 --> 00:52:42.000
About Khun Parat’s project—

00:52:42.833 --> 00:52:44.500
are you okay

00:52:44.900 --> 00:52:46.633
with competing against Mind Space again?

00:52:49.700 --> 00:52:51.166
It’s not… entirely okay.

00:52:52.300 --> 00:52:53.500
But if I run away—

00:52:53.933 --> 00:52:56.400
I’ll never escape this feeling.

00:52:57.233 --> 00:52:59.600
P'Mind will haunt me for the rest of my life.

00:53:03.233 --> 00:53:04.733
But I’m sure of one thing.

00:53:05.333 --> 00:53:06.733
If I have you—

00:53:07.333 --> 00:53:09.700
and everyone from Jinta Architect beside me—

00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:11.400
We can do it.

00:53:17.666 --> 00:53:19.166
I made you a promise, remember?

00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:21.000
I’ll bring you the victory.

00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:22.700
I never forgot that.

00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:24.800
And I will make it happen.

00:53:25.100 --> 00:53:26.566
You can believe in me!

00:53:29.066 --> 00:53:30.066
Always.

00:53:35.233 --> 00:53:36.200
But first—

00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:37.500
you have to tell me something.

00:53:37.633 --> 00:53:40.366
When did you secretly design Khun Rain’s house?

00:53:40.566 --> 00:53:41.866
I had no idea at all.

00:53:43.833 --> 00:53:45.200
When you were asleep, of course.

00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:48.233
I need more detail.

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:19.400
That drawing of your—

00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:22.400
it made me want to start sketching again.

00:54:23.566 --> 00:54:25.300
Every night after you’d fallen asleep,

00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:28.133
I’d turn on my laptop and work on it.

00:54:29.166 --> 00:54:30.566
I didn’t tell anyone because—

00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:33.400
I thought I was just doing it for fun.

00:54:33.666 --> 00:54:35.500
Never planned to show it to anyone.

00:54:35.966 --> 00:54:37.366
I just... wanted to create something.

00:54:56.900 --> 00:54:58.133
What are you smiling at?

00:54:59.466 --> 00:55:01.000
I’m just happy.

00:55:01.700 --> 00:55:03.600
Happy that you’ve started drawing again.

00:55:06.066 --> 00:55:09.066
Glad you’re doing what you love again—

00:55:09.066 --> 00:55:11.066
something that truly makes you happy.

00:55:13.966 --> 00:55:15.066
And that you’re not—

00:55:15.066 --> 00:55:18.200
not in pain when you think about it anymore.

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:27.300
I really mean it.

00:55:27.300 --> 00:55:29.000
Tears of joy, see?

00:55:32.900 --> 00:55:33.933
This project—

00:55:34.733 --> 00:55:36.666
I’ll prove to everyone—

00:55:36.866 --> 00:55:38.800
that our company can do it.

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:43.033
We’ll win—without cheating anyone.

00:55:43.766 --> 00:55:45.900
Even if we lose—

00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:47.333
we’ll lose in a way—

00:55:47.466 --> 00:55:50.066
that makes people wonder why we didn’t win.

00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:54.900
Someone out there will see how hard we tried.

00:55:58.766 --> 00:55:59.900
You know what, sis?

00:56:05.300 --> 00:56:06.833
It’s because you’re like this—

00:56:08.433 --> 00:56:09.700
that’s why I love you.

00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:24.533
Do you love me too?

00:56:28.866 --> 00:56:30.633
I don’t want to keep wondering alone anymore.

00:56:39.266 --> 00:56:40.466
How could I not love you?

00:56:45.466 --> 00:56:46.433
Really?

00:56:52.166 --> 00:56:53.766
I love you, Rin.

00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:09.666
Don't cry, you'll make me cry too.

01:00:03.466 --> 01:00:04.766
Here it is!

01:00:04.966 --> 01:00:06.133
Your coffee!

01:00:06.933 --> 01:00:07.833
Thank you!

01:00:10.833 --> 01:00:11.933
What are you thinking about?

01:00:12.300 --> 01:00:14.233
The pitching project for Khun Parat, of course.

01:00:14.466 --> 01:00:15.866
I’ve been thinking about it for days.

01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:17.766
Still can’t come up with a brilliant idea.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.766
If you can’t think, take a break then.

01:00:21.433 --> 01:00:23.233
Let’s talk about something important instead.

01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:25.533
About what?

01:00:26.433 --> 01:00:28.333
The HPV vaccine.

01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:30.400
You know, the vaccine can—

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:32.400
prevent several types of cancer.

01:00:32.566 --> 01:00:33.800
Now both women and men—

01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:36.066
even teenagers—
are getting it a lot these days.

01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:40.133
But… we haven’t done anything risky, have we?

01:00:40.300 --> 01:00:43.566
Even if it’s not risky, it’s still good to protect ourselves.

01:00:44.133 --> 01:00:45.833
The virus can hide in our body—

01:00:45.833 --> 01:00:47.466
for years without you even knowing it.

01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:48.700
And if you do get infected—

01:00:48.700 --> 01:00:51.033
it could lead to cancer, sis!

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.833
I just want you to stay healthy.

01:00:55.066 --> 01:00:56.733
So you can be with me for a long, long time.

01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:01.033
It’s not just about taking care of yourself—

01:01:01.100 --> 01:01:02.433
it’s also—

01:01:02.466 --> 01:01:05.466
showing responsibility to the people we love.

01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:08.566
- Mhm… you’re right.

01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:10.100
- And one more thing—

01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:12.666
the vaccine’s cheaper than the treatment.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.366
That's true.

01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:16.933
Come on, sis—
let’s get the shot together!

01:01:17.133 --> 01:01:18.633
Do it with me, please?

01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:21.466
Ughh, but I’m scared of needles!

01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:24.700
Oh, come on — it’s just a tiny needle!

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.266
I’m way scarier than that.

01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:31.033
Nope, not going!

01:01:31.366 --> 01:01:32.966
Let’s gooo!

01:01:33.100 --> 01:01:34.833
Just this tiny poke!

01:01:34.833 --> 01:01:36.100
- No way!
- Hurry up!

01:01:36.133 --> 01:01:37.166
It’s scary!

01:01:37.166 --> 01:01:39.033
Gives me goosebumps!

01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:43.000
I’m not going, nope nope nope!

01:01:43.133 --> 01:01:44.366
So, are you going now?

01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:47.133
Okay. I’ll go.

01:01:47.633 --> 01:01:49.233
- For real?
- For real!

01:01:49.366 --> 01:01:50.433
Promise me first.

01:01:50.700 --> 01:01:51.466
Promise.

01:01:51.466 --> 01:01:52.566
No backing out!

01:01:52.700 --> 01:01:54.033
You have to stay in the room with me—
No where else!

01:01:54.266 --> 01:01:56.400
- Fine, I’ll even make you laugh!
- Okay, deal!

01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:57.833
Deal.

01:01:58.266 --> 01:01:59.900
Booking it now — hospital nearby!

01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:01.633
Right now, before you change your mind.

01:02:13.733 --> 01:02:15.633
Your girlfriend’s too cute, right?

01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:29.466
I want you to keep working for me.

01:02:29.833 --> 01:02:31.333
Think of it as an advance payment.

01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:33.300
Uh, excuse me, Khun Aokbab—

01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:35.700
What about the spy inside our team?

01:02:36.133 --> 01:02:37.466
Do you have anyone in mind?

01:02:37.833 --> 01:02:40.366
Not a hundred percent sure yet — we’ll confirm when we’ve got proof.

01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:41.933
I’ll tell you then.

01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:44.066
You want me to continue from this design, P’Thee?

01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:45.700
Where did you even get it?

01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:47.866
You don't need to questions. Just do as I say.

01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:51.666
So do you guys know who is the spy yet?

01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:53.533
We’re still gathering evidence.

01:02:53.566 --> 01:02:54.633
And the rest—

01:02:54.833 --> 01:02:57.766
we’ll catch them red-handed.

01:02:59.566 --> 01:03:11.600
[MUSIC]

01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:18.300
It’s my fault — for trusting you with all my heart.

01:03:18.333 --> 01:03:25.166
My fault — for loving you far too much.

01:03:25.333 --> 01:03:32.766
Never thought you’d walk away… without a single goodbye.

01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:38.433
Leaving behind only the beautiful memories.

01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:43.933
When you left, my heart was still holding on.

01:03:43.933 --> 01:03:47.433
It hurts… not knowing why.

01:03:47.433 --> 01:03:54.033
Tell me — what did I do wrong?

01:03:54.033 --> 01:03:57.533
I’m not asking you to come back.

01:03:57.566 --> 01:04:00.666
I’m not asking to love again.

01:04:01.133 --> 01:04:04.600
Just… help me end this.

01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:07.733
So I can erase what’s still lingering.

01:04:07.766 --> 01:04:11.766
I don’t need you to return.

01:04:11.766 --> 01:04:14.766
I just need… your goodbye.

01:04:14.766 --> 01:04:18.733
Let the love we once built together…

01:04:18.733 --> 01:04:25.833
Fade away — disappear from my heart.

01:04:29.233 --> 01:04:36.433
I just want to ask — why did you leave?

01:04:36.433 --> 01:04:42.966
I need to know… did you ever truly love me?

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.900
Back then, I truly believed — you were the one.

01:04:46.900 --> 01:04:50.200
The only one my heart ever chose.

01:04:50.233 --> 01:04:57.633
Every memory we shared still means so much.

01:04:57.633 --> 01:05:01.533
I’ve never forgotten the story we left unfinished.

01:05:01.566 --> 01:05:04.866
It still hurts… it still tears me apart.

01:05:04.866 --> 01:05:11.566
To be abandoned — with tears that never stop falling.

01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:14.800
I’m not asking you to come back.

01:05:14.833 --> 01:05:18.733
I’m not asking to love again.

01:05:18.766 --> 01:05:22.266
Just… help me end this.

01:05:22.266 --> 01:05:25.366
So I can erase what’s still lingering.

01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:29.366
I don’t need you to return.

01:05:29.366 --> 01:05:32.800
I just need… your goodbye.

01:05:32.833 --> 01:05:36.366
Let the love we once built together…

01:05:36.366 --> 01:05:42.866
Fade away — disappear from my heart.

01:05:53.933 --> 01:05:57.500
I’m not asking you to come back.

01:05:57.500 --> 01:06:01.066
I’m not asking to love again.

01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:04.666
Just… help me end this.

01:06:04.666 --> 01:06:07.700
So I can erase what’s still lingering.

01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:11.466
I don’t need you to return.

01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:15.200
I just need… your goodbye.

01:06:15.233 --> 01:06:19.000
Let the love we once built together…

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:25.833
Fade away — disappear from my heart. [Music]
