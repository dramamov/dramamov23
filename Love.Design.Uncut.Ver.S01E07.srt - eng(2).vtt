00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:22.033
The concept we’re presenting today is—

00:00:22.033 --> 00:00:23.566
“Love Life Balance.”

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.766
Khun Aokbab!

00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:25.666
Look at this.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.166
This—this is our design!

00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:29.366
I have another house design. We’ll use that one.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.300
The company that will be renovating our home is—

00:00:34.433 --> 00:00:36.766
—Mind Space.

00:00:37.833 --> 00:00:40.433
Would your team be interested in pitching for our new hotel project?

00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:43.766
Jinta Architects will join the pitch.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.900
I’ll prove it to everyone—

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.866
—that our company can do this.

00:01:57.233 --> 00:01:58.266
So...

00:01:59.366 --> 00:02:01.800
what are we, exactly?

00:02:07.933 --> 00:02:09.000
We’re dating. Simple as that.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.900
Mmm... and if everyone finds out?

00:02:20.466 --> 00:02:21.833
Then let them.

00:02:21.833 --> 00:02:23.633
Whatever they say— it’s their problem, not ours.

00:02:23.933 --> 00:02:26.133
As long as we love each other, only that's matters.

Wait—

00:04:13.666 --> 00:04:15.066
You're not ready.

00:04:15.866 --> 00:04:17.000
I’ll fix it up.

00:04:18.233 --> 00:04:19.733
Switch to granite.

00:04:19.766 --> 00:04:21.133
– Like this?
– Looks better, trust me.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.233
– You sure?
– Yeah, look at the next page.

00:04:23.333 --> 00:04:24.866
Check this sample here.

00:04:25.666 --> 00:04:26.466
Hey, Yong.

00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:28.666
I’m not imagining things… right?

00:04:31.233 --> 00:04:32.866
If you’re seeing it, then I’m seeing it too.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.066
I’ll tell you guys the whole story later.

00:04:36.166 --> 00:04:37.533
Then spill it now, bro.

00:04:37.533 --> 00:04:38.166
So, here’s the thing—

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.233
Oh! They’re here!

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.766
I think we go with this one.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.233
So this is the final one, right?

00:04:45.233 --> 00:04:47.633
This one’s good too... but yeah, switch to this.

00:04:47.633 --> 00:04:49.533
Give it five minutes.

00:04:49.566 --> 00:04:51.700
Get ready. We will have a meeting.

00:04:51.866 --> 00:04:53.966
Something important to announced

00:05:00.566 --> 00:05:03.266
– Got it!
– Yup!

00:05:18.233 --> 00:05:19.700
The reason I called everyone in today—

00:05:19.766 --> 00:05:22.733
is to announce that our company will join the pitching for—

00:05:22.733 --> 00:05:24.266
Khun Parat’s hotel project.

00:05:24.766 --> 00:05:25.566
I know…

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.766
this is the biggest project we’ve ever taken on.

00:05:28.933 --> 00:05:31.033
And I’m sure everyone’s feeling the pressure.

00:05:32.266 --> 00:05:33.933
But it’s also a great opportunity—

00:05:33.966 --> 00:05:36.333
to show everyone what we’re truly capable of.

00:05:38.166 --> 00:05:40.966
And I’m confident this time we’ll make a comeback—

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.966
and beat Mind Space fair and square.

00:05:45.133 --> 00:05:46.466
And we’ll make sure—

00:05:46.533 --> 00:05:50.133
nothing like the stolen design incident ever happens again.

00:05:52.733 --> 00:05:54.133
– Let’s do this!
– Bring it on!

00:05:58.066 --> 00:05:59.200
Uh… Boss?

00:06:00.266 --> 00:06:02.000
What about the mole situation?

00:06:12.666 --> 00:06:13.866
I don’t think we have one.

00:06:13.966 --> 00:06:15.066
A mole, I mean.

00:06:17.566 --> 00:06:19.100
I trust our team.

00:06:19.733 --> 00:06:21.966
So let’s not start doubting each other.

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:23.500
Yeah.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.466
We see each other every day.

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.333
Been through so much together already.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.333
No one here would ever do that.

00:06:31.166 --> 00:06:32.100
Right?

00:06:45.666 --> 00:06:47.900
Why are you giving me this money, Khun Thee?

00:06:49.766 --> 00:06:52.100
I wasn’t the one who sent you that house design.

00:06:54.266 --> 00:06:55.233
Just take it.

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:57.600
Consider it an advance payment.

00:06:57.933 --> 00:06:59.866
I want you to keep working for me.

00:07:12.866 --> 00:07:14.900
For the next job, I expect—

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:16.800
you’ll make it worth my money.

00:07:17.566 --> 00:07:19.333
And if you do…

00:07:20.433 --> 00:07:21.833
I’ll double your pay.

00:07:30.266 --> 00:07:31.666
Khun Tertis…

00:07:32.466 --> 00:07:34.100
Don’t you still want the house?

00:07:51.866 --> 00:07:53.733
Then who was it—

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:56.400
who sent you Khun Rain’s house design?

00:07:58.366 --> 00:08:00.800
That’s something you don’t need to know.

00:08:01.133 --> 00:08:02.900
Just focus on doing your job.

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:19.400
About the mole…

00:08:19.933 --> 00:08:21.800
Do you really think it’s not someone from our team?

00:08:23.366 --> 00:08:24.966
Honestly… I’m not entirely sure.

00:08:25.833 --> 00:08:27.800
But I don’t want everyone turning suspicious of each other.

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:28.900
Pointing fingers all the time.

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:31.133
It’ll make it hard for us to work together.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.400
Then… who do you suspect?

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:44.766
Who is it?

00:08:45.633 --> 00:08:47.166
Right now…

00:08:47.433 --> 00:08:49.100
I can’t say for sure just yet.

00:08:49.466 --> 00:08:50.866
Let me confirm it first.

00:08:50.966 --> 00:08:52.133
Then I’ll tell you.

00:08:53.133 --> 00:08:55.700
So for now, just focus on Khun Parat’s project.

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:57.366
As for the mole…

00:08:57.933 --> 00:08:59.266
Leave that to your two brothers.

00:09:00.333 --> 00:09:02.100
You sure you can handle it?

00:09:02.966 --> 00:09:03.900
Of course.

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:05.933
We’ve got a plan.

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.466
I’m nervous, sis.

00:09:21.833 --> 00:09:23.900
It’s just a briefing, nothing big.

00:09:24.066 --> 00:09:26.033
But it’s such a huge project! Aren’t you even a little nervous?

00:09:26.266 --> 00:09:28.233
I’ve got you by my side. Nothing to scaried of.

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.200
I didn’t expect to see you on this project, Khun Aokbab.

00:09:38.833 --> 00:09:39.933
From now on—

00:09:39.966 --> 00:09:42.300
you’ll be seeing us a lot more, Khun Thee.

00:09:44.033 --> 00:09:44.966
I look forward to it.

00:09:45.166 --> 00:09:47.900
I hope this project will be another fun competition between us.

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:50.400
Oh, I’m sure it will be.

00:09:50.666 --> 00:09:52.433
Don’t worry, Khun Thee—

00:09:52.633 --> 00:09:55.000
this time, there won’t be any shady tricks.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:04.933
Of course.

00:10:22.766 --> 00:10:25.900
The new branch of The Eraside Hotel that’s about to open—

00:10:25.933 --> 00:10:28.500
I want it to be modern,

00:10:28.566 --> 00:10:30.566
stylish, and one of a kind.

00:10:30.733 --> 00:10:33.200
But most importantly, I want it to be—

00:10:33.333 --> 00:10:35.133
a hotel of the future.

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.866
While still keeping The Eraside identity alive.

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:43.133
I want every guest who walks through our doors—

00:10:43.166 --> 00:10:46.866
to feel the essence of The Eraside.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.600
It’s a five-star hotel.

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:51.900
We’re here to deliver a flawless experience—

00:10:51.933 --> 00:10:54.833
one that leaves every guest truly impressed.

00:10:59.466 --> 00:11:01.466
That’s the feeling… the soul I want to capture...

00:11:42.333 --> 00:11:43.166
So, how’s it going?

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:44.733
Found anything interesting yet?

00:11:46.266 --> 00:11:47.600
Not yet.

00:11:47.766 --> 00:11:50.600
I’ll sleep on it for a night or two first.

00:11:59.666 --> 00:12:00.700
What are you staring at?

00:12:02.133 --> 00:12:05.033
Just admiring my beautiful girlfriend.

00:12:05.966 --> 00:12:07.000
You Sweet talker.

00:12:11.733 --> 00:12:13.000
Wanna taste how sweet?

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:17.200
Are you crazy? We’re in a library!

00:12:19.233 --> 00:12:21.133
Seeing you smile makes me feel better.

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:22.966
Thought you’d still be stressed.

00:12:23.133 --> 00:12:24.566
After running into that old hag.

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:26.266
Ugh…

00:12:27.366 --> 00:12:29.933
If I’m gonna stress, I’d rather stress over who the mole is.

00:12:30.666 --> 00:12:31.966
I still don’t get it—

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.333
How P'Pad and P'Chan plan to handle this.

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:03.800
What made you pick this place?

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.566
It’s…

00:13:05.566 --> 00:13:06.833
pretty fancy.

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:09.000
That’s exactly why I picked it.

00:13:09.466 --> 00:13:11.033
I wanted to take you somewhere nice.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.266
I just wanted to have a nice dinner date with you.

00:13:16.966 --> 00:13:18.100
My treat tonight.

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:21.700
Isn’t it a bit expensive though?

00:13:22.633 --> 00:13:23.966
Maybe we should go somewhere simpler.

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:28.733
It’s fine.

00:13:28.933 --> 00:13:30.333
I can afford it.

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:34.600
Besides… I kind of want to spend it all anyway.

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:37.933
What do you mean?

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:52.900
You know, P’Vee…

00:13:55.066 --> 00:13:57.300
about the Khun Rain pitching project that won—

00:13:59.433 --> 00:14:01.933
– Your company copied ours.
– What?

00:14:03.566 --> 00:14:05.300
Why didn’t I know anything about this?

00:14:06.233 --> 00:14:08.366
Why didn’t you tell me that day?

00:14:09.866 --> 00:14:11.500
And how did you even find out?

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.533
From the picture you sent me… during the pitching.

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:15.333
Huh?

00:14:15.833 --> 00:14:16.800
Wait a sec—

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:18.533
I’m completely lost here.

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:22.500
I haven’t been involved in that project since Khun Thee brought in his new team.

00:14:22.733 --> 00:14:25.800
I had no idea that design belonged to Jinta.

00:14:26.066 --> 00:14:27.666
So… it’s true?

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:34.833
But how do you know for sure?

00:14:39.166 --> 00:14:41.466
Khun Thee paid me to take the company’s data—

00:14:41.966 --> 00:14:43.200
and hand it over to Mind Space.

00:14:46.433 --> 00:14:48.200
But I never wanted to do it, P’Vee…

00:14:48.466 --> 00:14:49.666
I’ve been feeling awful ever since. 😔

00:14:49.666 --> 00:14:50.633
Was it… because of the money?

00:14:52.166 --> 00:14:55.700
– I just wanted to help you earn some money.
– Not like this, Tertis.

00:14:55.933 --> 00:14:57.133
But I didn’t do it!

00:14:57.133 --> 00:14:59.300
– I only—
– How am I supposed to believe you?

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.300
You take me to a place like this...

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:06.800
where’d you get the money?

00:15:08.333 --> 00:15:09.466
If not from—

00:15:53.166 --> 00:15:54.066
Here, you guys.

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:58.000
This is the new project.

00:15:59.166 --> 00:16:01.000
We have to make a comeback this time.

00:16:01.833 --> 00:16:02.633
Got it.

00:16:11.466 --> 00:16:13.033
Wait… you guys think I’m the mole?

00:16:13.533 --> 00:16:14.800
I’m not the rat, okay?

00:16:17.233 --> 00:16:18.433
Just focus on your work.

00:16:36.166 --> 00:16:37.033
What are you looking at?

00:16:37.166 --> 00:16:38.433
I’m not the mole!

00:16:43.266 --> 00:16:44.666
According to Khun Pad’s schedule—

00:16:44.666 --> 00:16:47.466
Monday the 30th should be possible, around midday.

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:49.000
Okay, got it.

00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:10.000
Alright, everyone—Stop whatever you are doing.

00:17:11.166 --> 00:17:12.233
Alright, take a seat.

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:23.066
Let’s clear the air right now.

00:17:24.666 --> 00:17:26.666
The tension in this office—

00:17:28.266 --> 00:17:30.500
—is because everyone’s afraid there’s a mole, right?

00:17:39.766 --> 00:17:43.366
Let’s remind ourselves of Jinta Architect’s core principles.

00:17:44.433 --> 00:17:45.533
Go ahead, Khun Aobbaeb.

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:48.066
Please stand.

00:17:53.866 --> 00:17:55.400
Every design we create—

00:17:55.466 --> 00:17:57.366
—comes from love and understanding.

00:17:57.733 --> 00:17:59.166
We work with heart.

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:00.533
Exactly.

00:18:00.833 --> 00:18:02.566
We have to work with heart.

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:06.100
Think about it.

00:18:06.433 --> 00:18:08.166
We’ve been working together every single day.

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:10.300
For years.

00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:11.966
Who—

00:18:12.866 --> 00:18:14.233
Who would even dare—

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:16.933
—to betray, to spy on their own team?

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.066
Right?

00:18:50.033 --> 00:18:51.233
Thank you.

00:18:59.633 --> 00:19:02.000
So... are you finally gonna tell us why we’re here?

00:19:02.733 --> 00:19:03.700
Hold on.

00:19:04.433 --> 00:19:05.766
Not everyone’s here yet.

00:19:06.666 --> 00:19:07.966
Who else are we waiting for?

00:19:10.233 --> 00:19:12.233
This feels more intense than testifying in court.

00:19:44.433 --> 00:19:46.366
Wait—are you two dating?

00:19:47.066 --> 00:19:48.633
Yes, Khun Aobbaeb.

00:19:49.766 --> 00:19:51.966
We’ve been together for over a year now.

00:19:53.433 --> 00:19:55.400
Then that means the stolen design—

00:19:55.466 --> 00:19:56.733
—was your doing?

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.333
Nope.

00:20:00.766 --> 00:20:03.700
That bastard Thee hired Tertis to be a mole in our company—

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:05.566
feeding him our data and info.

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:09.500
Tis... is that true?!

00:20:09.966 --> 00:20:11.400
Then why the hell are you crying?

00:20:11.666 --> 00:20:12.866
Say something!

00:20:13.766 --> 00:20:15.166
Since when did you guys know about this?

00:20:15.366 --> 00:20:16.800
Since the very beginning.

00:20:17.266 --> 00:20:19.300
We noticed Tertis had been acting...

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:20.900
...strange.

00:20:36.633 --> 00:20:38.433
Tell us, what’s really going on.

00:20:39.766 --> 00:20:41.133
We can help you.

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:54.100
Remember the day of your interview?

00:20:55.533 --> 00:20:56.933
We told you back then—

00:20:57.933 --> 00:21:00.066
—this company runs like a family.

00:21:01.133 --> 00:21:02.600
We always look out for each other.

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:07.000
We’re worried about you, Tertis.

00:21:28.066 --> 00:21:31.666
Khun Thee from Mind Space… he offered me a deal—to be a spy for him.

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:39.600
He wanted me to leak information from the company.

00:21:39.733 --> 00:21:41.133
And he said he’d pay me for it.

00:21:42.333 --> 00:21:44.133
I’ve been so stressed out, barely can't take it anymore.

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:47.433
That bastard Thee... he’s pulling his dirty tricks again, huh?!

00:21:49.366 --> 00:21:51.366
Wait—did you take the deal?

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:55.100
I would never take his offer.

00:21:55.266 --> 00:21:56.466
No matter how much money he offered—

00:21:56.533 --> 00:21:57.833
I love Jinta.

00:21:57.866 --> 00:21:59.466
I’d never betray this family.

00:22:13.466 --> 00:22:15.266
But... I want you to take Thee's offer.

00:22:17.166 --> 00:22:18.200
What? Why?!

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.366
Because if you don’t do it—

00:22:22.433 --> 00:22:23.733
—someone else eventually will.

00:22:25.133 --> 00:22:27.133
I want you to take everything Thee tells you—

00:22:27.333 --> 00:22:28.733
—and report it straight to us.

00:22:34.133 --> 00:22:35.566
I… I don’t think I can do that.

00:22:41.066 --> 00:22:42.000
You can.

00:22:42.266 --> 00:22:43.500
We’ll—

00:22:43.733 --> 00:22:45.033
even give you a special bonus.

00:22:45.266 --> 00:22:47.166
Then you can also grab Thee’s as well.

00:22:48.066 --> 00:22:48.966
Two birds, one stone.

00:22:50.433 --> 00:22:51.166
Yeah.

00:22:55.766 --> 00:22:58.200
So losing Khun Rain’s project…

00:22:58.233 --> 00:22:59.966
—that was all part of your plan?

00:23:00.933 --> 00:23:02.200
Calm down, sis.

00:23:02.766 --> 00:23:04.233
Tertis had nothing to do with that.

00:23:04.466 --> 00:23:05.433
She wasn’t the one who leaked it.

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:08.800
Thee planted another mole inside our company.

00:23:09.633 --> 00:23:13.033
I can’t believe Khun Thee would stoop this low…

00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:15.700
So… do you guys know, who's the mole yet?

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:22.500
We’re still gathering evidence.

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:24.100
And once we have it—

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:26.200
—we’ll catch that mole red-handed.

00:23:58.533 --> 00:23:59.433
Everyone—

00:23:59.466 --> 00:24:02.100
Let’s call it a day. We’ll pick this up again tomorrow.

00:24:02.566 --> 00:24:04.333
Got it, thank you!

00:24:04.433 --> 00:24:06.733
- We’ll talk more in LINE.
- Sure thing.

00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:11.866
Rin—

00:24:11.966 --> 00:24:12.933
Let’s go.

00:24:13.666 --> 00:24:14.833
Saving the file—

00:24:15.966 --> 00:24:16.966
Okay.

00:24:19.133 --> 00:24:19.800
Let’s go.

00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:44.066
Do you have something to say to us… Auntie?

00:25:48.366 --> 00:25:50.233
Khun Thee told me to—

00:25:51.166 --> 00:25:53.866
—take photos of all the projects Jinta’s been working on.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.700
And send it to him.

00:25:56.166 --> 00:25:57.866
I didn’t know…

00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:00.200
…which project was which.

00:26:01.366 --> 00:26:03.533
My job was just to take the pictures—

00:26:04.566 --> 00:26:06.566
—and send them over, that’s all.

00:26:07.633 --> 00:26:09.533
I really needed the money…

00:26:11.166 --> 00:26:12.566
I was going to use it—

00:26:12.833 --> 00:26:16.466
—to pay for my sick granddaughter’s treatment.

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:19.600
But what you did, Auntie—

00:26:19.833 --> 00:26:21.566
—it affects everyone here.

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:23.933
Khun Aokbab…

00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:26.500
I’m really so sorry.

00:26:27.833 --> 00:26:29.833
Please don’t report me… please.

00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:36.833
Then how about this?

00:26:41.233 --> 00:26:42.800
You’ll take the hard drive to Thee—

00:26:43.166 --> 00:26:45.300
—but don’t you tell him you got caught.

00:26:45.766 --> 00:26:47.066
Keep acting like his informant.

00:26:47.566 --> 00:26:50.000
Do this for us, and we won’t press charges.

00:26:50.766 --> 00:26:52.133
Sound fair?

00:28:02.566 --> 00:28:04.633
You want me to continue working from this design?

00:28:06.533 --> 00:28:07.466
Yeah.

00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:11.133
Just make it look more luxurious.

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:12.833
This isn’t high-end enough.

00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:22.000
Where did you even get this design, P'Thee?

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:24.100
- Don’t tell me it’s from Jinta.
- Don’t ask.

00:28:24.166 --> 00:28:25.633
We’ve already talked about this.

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:27.933
Just do what I told you to.

00:28:47.933 --> 00:28:49.133
From this point on—

00:28:49.133 --> 00:28:50.866
—we’ll stick with this concept.

00:28:51.533 --> 00:28:53.766
Rin and I have already worked out the basics.

00:28:54.366 --> 00:28:56.433
We’ll need everyone’s help for the rest.

00:28:58.666 --> 00:29:01.533
Uh, so… are we scrapping the first draft entirely?

00:29:02.266 --> 00:29:03.833
No — not scrapping it.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.266
We’ll use it — to bait Mind Space instead.

00:29:07.233 --> 00:29:10.033
If they’re so desperate… so have it.

00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:16.000
Nice.

00:29:19.266 --> 00:29:20.866
It’s gonna be tough everyone—

00:29:21.166 --> 00:29:23.866
—but there’ll be extra bonuses at the end of the year for sure!

00:29:24.166 --> 00:29:26.866
Let’s give it everything we’ve got and win this pitch together!

00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:29.600
- Yay!
- Let’s do this!

00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:30.866
On your feet, everyone!

00:29:30.866 --> 00:29:32.266
Time to assign the tasks!

00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:33.533
Come on, let’s move!

00:30:26.233 --> 00:30:27.766
Pretending to sleep?

00:30:27.966 --> 00:30:32.166
I pass out on this sofa every night… haven’t even washed my face.

00:30:33.033 --> 00:30:35.800
I’ll wipe it for you.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.466
No whining— come here.

00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:56.200
What are you up to?

00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:57.566
Can I have a bite?

00:30:58.366 --> 00:30:59.533
- Nom!
- Mmm.

00:30:59.666 --> 00:31:00.766
Keep going, You’ve got this.

00:31:00.866 --> 00:31:03.933
- Fighto.
- P'Teddy bear’s cheering for you.

00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:33.666
Everyone—

00:32:33.733 --> 00:32:35.233
That’s it for today.

00:32:35.266 --> 00:32:36.633
Let’s pick it up again tomorrow.

00:32:36.633 --> 00:32:39.633
- Yay!

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:43.233
Uh, wait a sec, boss—

00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:45.266
I’ve got a serious question.

00:32:45.333 --> 00:32:48.000
And I’m pretty sure everyone here wants to know too.

00:32:49.966 --> 00:32:50.800
What is it?

00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:52.433
You and Rin…

00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:53.633
what exactly are you two?

00:33:02.833 --> 00:33:03.900
We’re dating.

00:33:03.933 --> 00:33:05.733
Yay!

00:33:09.266 --> 00:33:12.000
- What!?
- Told you she’d admit it!

00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:13.066
Now, Pay up! I won!

00:33:13.166 --> 00:33:15.600
- Wait till payday, okay?
- No way, pay now!

00:33:17.466 --> 00:33:19.266
Hey, hey! What’s going on here?

00:33:19.366 --> 00:33:21.500
She’s lying! Ask her yourself!

00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:23.633
Rin, tell us— are you really her girlfriend?

00:33:23.666 --> 00:33:24.533
Of course!

00:33:24.566 --> 00:33:26.333
I’m dating Khun Aokbab.

00:33:34.833 --> 00:33:37.133
So, as CEO’s girlfriend—

00:33:37.133 --> 00:33:40.133
Any special privileges?

00:33:42.066 --> 00:33:43.900
Let’s go eat!

00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:53.233
I’m exhausted… I need a recharge.

00:33:53.266 --> 00:33:54.133
Hey—

00:33:54.133 --> 00:33:55.466
What do you feel like having for tonight?

00:33:55.466 --> 00:33:58.166
Wait, I need recharge first! Come on~

00:33:58.233 --> 00:33:59.466
Alright, alright.

00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:00.800
Aokbab

00:34:20.533 --> 00:34:22.233
I need to talk to you.

00:34:23.033 --> 00:34:24.266
Let's go.

00:34:24.266 --> 00:34:25.666
Don’t you want to know, Aokbab—

00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:28.833
why I took your design ten years ago?

00:34:33.733 --> 00:34:35.800
I want to tell you everything.

00:34:39.166 --> 00:34:40.266
Will you come with me?

00:34:42.866 --> 00:34:43.866
That’s not necessary.

00:34:44.166 --> 00:34:45.133
You don’t need to go, sis.

00:34:45.233 --> 00:34:46.233
Let’s just go home.

00:34:46.366 --> 00:34:47.433
But… I want to know.

00:34:51.700 --> 00:34:53.433
I just want this to finally end.

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:28.800
Before we talk about that…

00:35:30.666 --> 00:35:33.700
I want to talk about the last pitching first.

00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:44.733
P'Thee sent me the design himself.

00:35:46.166 --> 00:35:48.166
He handled everything himself.

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:52.700
I didn’t know anything.

00:35:53.533 --> 00:35:54.633
I’m sorry… truly.

00:36:09.133 --> 00:36:10.766
My mom was the mistress.

00:36:12.133 --> 00:36:13.766
I was the child my father never loved.

00:36:13.933 --> 00:36:15.233
He never cared about me.

00:36:18.566 --> 00:36:21.000
And I happened to be his only daughter.

00:36:24.366 --> 00:36:26.966
So I was the one who had to take care of him when he got sick.

00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:54.066
I had to study…

00:36:54.833 --> 00:36:56.433
work…

00:36:57.400 --> 00:36:59.200
and take care of him all at once.

00:37:17.366 --> 00:37:19.366
I wanted to prove myself to my father.

00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:21.400
… that I could do it too.

00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:28.400
I thought if I could just succeed—

00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:32.733
maybe… he’d finally accept me.

00:37:46.866 --> 00:37:48.666
So when that opportunity came—

00:37:50.366 --> 00:37:52.266
I need to taking it.

00:38:37.966 --> 00:38:39.000
Dad…

00:38:40.166 --> 00:38:41.000
Dad!

00:38:41.133 --> 00:38:42.233
Dad!

00:38:42.766 --> 00:38:43.900
Dad!

00:38:50.366 --> 00:38:51.666
Dad…

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.100
Patient’s heart-rate dropped!

00:39:13.466 --> 00:39:15.600
I drew this house to thank you.

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:17.533
For tutoring me, P’Mind.

00:39:18.433 --> 00:39:19.566
P’Mind

00:39:20.066 --> 00:39:21.566
— are my inspiration.

00:39:22.566 --> 00:39:24.800
I want to be a great architect like you.

00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:30.333
But when I saw the picture you drew for me…

00:39:30.666 --> 00:39:31.800
It was so beautiful.

00:39:37.733 --> 00:39:40.800
So beautiful that I thought… I could never create something like that myself.

00:39:55.466 --> 00:39:56.866
At that moment…

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.200
I saw it as my last chance.

00:40:00.133 --> 00:40:03.866
So I took your drawing… and did something unforgivable.

00:40:34.133 --> 00:40:35.933
I know my reasons don’t justify what I did.

00:40:37.166 --> 00:40:39.566
And I have no excuse.

00:40:49.366 --> 00:40:51.033
I’m sorry, Aokbab.

00:40:52.933 --> 00:40:54.433
I was selfish…

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.133
Why didn’t you tell me… ten years ago?

00:40:59.466 --> 00:41:00.633
I didn’t have the courage.

00:41:02.533 --> 00:41:04.066
I was scared…

00:41:05.166 --> 00:41:07.000
Too scared to even face you.

00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:13.700
If you had told me back then,

00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:17.966
I wouldn’t have hated you this much.

00:41:19.966 --> 00:41:22.266
I might’ve even given you that design myself.

00:41:29.166 --> 00:41:30.800
I’m sorry, Aokbab…

00:41:37.066 --> 00:41:39.200
If I’d made the right choice back then…

00:41:43.866 --> 00:41:46.133
would we still love each other like we used to?

00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:18.266
I think it’s all part of her plan.

00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:19.900
Acting all pitiful—

00:42:20.133 --> 00:42:22.000
just to get attention.

00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:23.766
I don’t think it’s like that.

00:42:24.066 --> 00:42:26.066
Don’t overthink it, Rin.

00:42:26.966 --> 00:42:28.733
She’s too soft-hearted.

00:42:28.933 --> 00:42:30.733
I just… worry about her.

00:42:31.233 --> 00:42:34.400
But Khun Rin, you should trust Khun Aokbab.

00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:37.833
I do trust her—

00:42:38.033 --> 00:42:38.933
Um

00:42:39.366 --> 00:42:40.766
Then why are you so worked up?

00:42:42.366 --> 00:42:44.066
Don’t tell me… you’re jealous?

00:42:49.733 --> 00:42:51.933
Fine! Yeah, I am jealous.

00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:19.833
Love?

00:43:24.133 --> 00:43:26.566
That’s not what it is anymore, P'Mind.

00:43:39.466 --> 00:43:40.700
You said—

00:43:41.266 --> 00:43:44.400
We never officially broke up, right?

00:43:45.266 --> 00:43:47.400
Then let me say it now.

00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:56.800
Let’s break up.

00:43:57.866 --> 00:44:00.200
I don’t love you anymore.
