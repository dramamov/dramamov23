00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.680
Be patient. We'll be able to go home soon. Be patient.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.320
Don't you know, junior, that this area is a blind spot?

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.160
Miss Patty could be in danger.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.320
I'll come help you in a moment.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.440
A fashionista like Miss Patty should know how to wear this.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.000
I came to teach you massage, so you can massage me.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.160
I'm really enjoying this.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.640
Go, go, go

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.920
Ploy, Peerachada Khunrak as Achi

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.000
Punch, Naphassanan Kalaphan as Patty

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.880
Tian, Atcharee Buakhiao as Alice

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.840
Kitty, Nunthaphuck Aranyakasemsuk as Chama

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.640
Here, massage.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.120
Do it the way I taught you.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.520
Use more pressure.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.960
Like that.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.040
Now you're finally being a bit useful.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.600
Since you've been here, this is the first day I've seen you be useful.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.200
Harder.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.360
Oh, I see.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.360
After the recent assault incident,

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.240
Birom's face looks much brighter today,

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.280
and he says he's ready to answer all questions.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.800
Don't worry too much, Miss Patty.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.560
Soon you'll be able to go back and see your father.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:48.760
Thank you.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.640
Seeing news like this,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.800
Miss Patty must be stressed, right?

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:58.520
Yeah.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.440
But it's okay.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.960
I understand the various situations well.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.280
If any day you're suffering and can't bear it, want to vent,

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.240
Miss Patty can talk to Chama anytime.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.760
Because Chama listens with the left ear and it goes right through the right ear immediately.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.640
I forget in a second, I won't hold it against you.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:26.840
(Laughs)

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:29.960
You're so cute.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.240
I guess only Miss Patty would say something like that.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.920
Really?

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.680
Well, the person who wants to be praised never praises me at all.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.920
Who? Achi?

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.000
Yes.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.040
Chama always tries to be good to Achi,

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.480
but Achi never pays attention to Chama at all.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.040
It hurts to talk about it.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.080
Where are you going?

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:58.880
Shh...

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000
What happened?

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.720
I saw something. I'm going to check it out.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:11.560
Should Chama come with you?

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.400
No need.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.400
Chama, stay in this room. I'll be back.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.120
Won't be long.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:17.960
Achi.

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:19.720
Yes, it's me.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.800
Hey, why are you grabbing me?

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.360
Go after that woman first, quick. I don't know where she went!

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.160
Why are you holding me?

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:29.280
Let go!

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.560
Why are you grabbing me?

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.600
I told you to be quiet.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.760
Hey! Which way did she go? Huh!

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:36.720
Let go!

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.240
Hey, I said let go.

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.680
If you don't let go, I'm going myself.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.800
You... why are you kissing me?

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.080
Because you wouldn't stop talking.

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.720
The person you should be catching is that one, not me.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.120
Still... still haven't learned your lesson.

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.480
What are you doing here anyway?

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:26.240
Ow.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.080
- Ow
- Miss Patty

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:30.560
What's wrong?

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.360
I feel dizzy.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:36.240
I think I got too much dew on me.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.120
Are you okay?

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:38.760
Then sit down and rest for a bit.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.640
I'll be right back.

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.040
Miss Patty, stay right here, don't go anywhere.

00:07:58.760 --> 00:07:59.840
Crazy.

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.560
Kissing like that.

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.320
What the...

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.400
Someone saw me.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.200
Huh! What did you do to get caught?

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:15.880
I don't know.

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:17.520
Get in the car first. We'll talk in the car.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:18.360
Ow.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.520
How did you let them see you, Pop?

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:26.520
I don't know. I didn't know there'd be someone there.

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:29.040
You're so unprofessional.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.800
I think you're going to get us killed, Pide.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:35.640
I don't think we'll die.

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:40.120
But if they trace it back to you, we'll die together for sure, Pop.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.680
What should we do?

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:47.240
First, we need to go back and tell the boss.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:49.920
Yeah, yeah.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:54.120
Hmm.

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:56.760
What kind of crazy person kisses like that?

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:58.600
Sigh~

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:06.840
Go, let's go back to the room.

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:08.520
Oh!

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.200
Where did she go?

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.760
I told her to wait here. So stubborn.

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.600
Are you okay?

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:22.480
Not really.

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.000
Hey, can't we move in together?

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:30.600
I've said it many times already, but they won't agree.

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:32.400
I don't know what to do either.

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:35.440
I feel really bad.

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:39.080
It's inconvenient to do anything. Like I'm being watched all the time.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:40.320
Really.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:41.760
Yeah.

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.000
She likes to spy on us, always watching.

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.600
Don't know what to care about.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.400
Is Miss Patty badly hurt anywhere?

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:56.600
I'm fine now.

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:01.680
Miss Patty!

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:03.840
Here you are. I've been looking everywhere.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.160
Alice, where have you been?

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:09.120
Do you know Miss Patty was outside alone just now?

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:11.080
How could you let her out of your sight?

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:12.400
It wasn't Alice.

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:15.680
It was you who left me and let me be alone.

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:19.640
Lucky that Alice found me and brought me here.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.360
I see.

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:25.200
Then... I apologize.

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:29.280
Let's go, Miss Patty. I'll take you.

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.720
No need. I'll have Alice take me.

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:41.840
Oh!

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:47.920
Achi!!!

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.680
What are you doing?

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.160
Here she comes again, that annoying girl.

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:54.440
Sigh~

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:59.000
I saw they have a fitness center here, so I was going to invite everyone to work out,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.240
and have Alice teach some self-defense techniques.

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:03.840
That junior?

00:11:22.688 --> 00:11:25.638
Sponsored by Pro Fresh Milk

00:11:29.978 --> 00:11:31.638
Convenient, finally some relief.

00:11:32.098 --> 00:11:35.018
- I have to win an Oscar this year
- Sure

00:11:40.828 --> 00:11:42.588
Sigh, so comfortable.

00:11:44.448 --> 00:11:47.238
Isn't every room the same? Same bed.

00:11:47.798 --> 00:11:52.798
Not the same, because this is Achi's bed and pillow.

00:11:53.638 --> 00:11:56.078
Both fragrant and softer too.

00:11:59.558 --> 00:12:01.528
This pillow has Achi's scent.

00:12:01.768 --> 00:12:03.958
Then can I take it to cuddle in my room?

00:12:04.388 --> 00:12:07.328
Then what will I sleep with? Think before you speak, Chama.

00:12:10.928 --> 00:12:14.308
And you're lying here playing around. Aren't you going back to take care of Miss Patty?

00:12:16.008 --> 00:12:18.578
No. Maybe later.

00:12:19.598 --> 00:12:22.638
This is called neglecting your duties.

00:12:23.398 --> 00:12:27.448
Aw, it's rare that I get to be alone with Achi.

00:12:27.448 --> 00:12:29.378
Can't I have just a bit more time?

00:12:29.638 --> 00:12:30.948
But...

00:12:32.418 --> 00:12:36.268
Alice is here too, why are you overthinking?

00:12:41.658 --> 00:12:42.538
Hey Achi.

00:12:42.998 --> 00:12:44.528
I think we should sit and talk.

00:12:45.138 --> 00:12:46.578
Hey, what's this?

00:12:47.698 --> 00:12:48.958
Come on.

00:12:49.628 --> 00:12:54.208
Ever since I met you, I haven't had a proper serious talk with Achi even once.

00:13:07.658 --> 00:13:12.228
Why does this room look so spacious and airy? It feels comfortable being here.

00:13:13.988 --> 00:13:14.788
Really?

00:13:15.508 --> 00:13:16.538
Yes.

00:13:17.108 --> 00:13:19.948
Plus the room design is even better.

00:13:20.528 --> 00:13:24.458
That's why staying in this room feels comfortable,

00:13:24.458 --> 00:13:25.748
not stuffy like that room.

00:13:26.898 --> 00:13:28.138
Wait.

00:13:28.448 --> 00:13:31.498
But aren't all the rooms the same?

00:13:31.568 --> 00:13:35.238
Or maybe the stuffiness isn't about the room,

00:13:35.888 --> 00:13:37.328
but something else.

00:13:37.758 --> 00:13:40.028
Yeah, makes sense we've been together so long.

00:13:40.228 --> 00:13:43.218
What kind of person? The more we're together, the more annoying.

00:13:43.508 --> 00:13:45.768
Why does heaven like to tease me so much?

00:13:46.578 --> 00:13:48.058
Really.

00:13:48.058 --> 00:13:51.638
Why won't heaven let me be alone with Achi?

00:13:52.078 --> 00:13:54.238
We work together all the time though.

00:13:56.258 --> 00:13:57.728
It's duty.

00:13:57.848 --> 00:14:00.918
I'm a bodyguard, I have to be with the bodyguard.

00:14:01.508 --> 00:14:02.388
Hey~

00:14:02.638 --> 00:14:06.128
What kind of bodyguard has no manners, speaks badly?

00:14:06.128 --> 00:14:07.498
Doesn't respect coworkers at all.

00:14:08.358 --> 00:14:12.128
Even though I'm junior, doesn't mean you have to suppress me like that.

00:14:12.518 --> 00:14:13.638
It's too bad.

00:14:13.988 --> 00:14:17.198
Come on, be patient a little longer.

00:14:17.448 --> 00:14:19.328
Soon we'll be able to go home.

00:14:19.948 --> 00:14:22.098
How much longer do I have to endure?

00:14:22.778 --> 00:14:24.438
Oh, come here.

00:14:24.668 --> 00:14:25.828
Just a little more.

00:14:26.488 --> 00:14:28.408
I can't stand it much longer.

00:14:30.898 --> 00:14:32.528
Please, be patient.

00:14:36.408 --> 00:14:39.188
When will this mission end soon?

00:14:39.728 --> 00:14:41.908
I prefer visiting you at home.

00:14:43.058 --> 00:14:44.058
Bored?

00:14:44.248 --> 00:14:45.268
Yes.

00:14:45.618 --> 00:14:47.898
If Achi wasn't here, I wouldn't come.

00:14:49.188 --> 00:14:53.178
If you could work with someone you like, you'd be very happy, right?

00:14:53.738 --> 00:14:54.488
Yeah.

00:14:54.988 --> 00:14:56.828
Very, very much.

00:14:59.858 --> 00:15:00.828
Chama.

00:15:01.408 --> 00:15:04.278
You see that I work very hard, right?

00:15:04.928 --> 00:15:08.338
And I'm very serious about work. Barely have time to go anywhere.

00:15:09.028 --> 00:15:10.508
You could say I'm crazy about it.

00:15:11.238 --> 00:15:15.508
Then if you want to work with someone you like and have plenty of time,

00:15:15.988 --> 00:15:18.048
why don't you try hitting on Alice?

00:15:21.238 --> 00:15:25.818
I think she doesn't care much about work. She probably has lots of time to do other things.

00:15:26.738 --> 00:15:31.398
Someone like that, if she had someone she liked, she'd probably be crazy in love, interesting to watch.

00:15:31.728 --> 00:15:32.618
You should try.

00:15:35.718 --> 00:15:37.368
Why are you saying this, Achi?

00:15:39.038 --> 00:15:41.508
You're looking down on my love.

00:15:45.288 --> 00:15:46.288
I'm not okay with this.

00:15:46.628 --> 00:15:47.708
What do you see me as?

00:15:47.708 --> 00:15:49.898
I'm not a thing, not a vegetable, not a fish,

00:15:49.898 --> 00:15:52.508
that you can just pass on or give away to anyone easily.

00:15:57.208 --> 00:15:58.118
Chama.

00:16:10.858 --> 00:16:12.408
You forgot your shoes.

00:16:29.688 --> 00:16:32.348
What the hell? Weird person.

00:16:48.068 --> 00:16:49.328
P'Natee, are you sure

00:16:49.888 --> 00:16:52.378
that no one knows we're here?

00:16:54.188 --> 00:16:56.308
Of course. Why? What happened?

00:16:57.828 --> 00:16:59.548
Well, yesterday at 8 PM,

00:16:59.548 --> 00:17:02.108
I went out to patrol around the rooms.

00:17:02.868 --> 00:17:05.648
I saw someone sneaking around suspiciously.

00:17:06.998 --> 00:17:09.458
Really? A resort employee?

00:17:10.768 --> 00:17:11.878
Probably not.

00:17:11.878 --> 00:17:14.118
Because if it was really a resort employee,

00:17:14.118 --> 00:17:16.928
when I walked toward them, they wouldn't have run away from me.

00:17:17.758 --> 00:17:19.448
That's what I'm thinking.

00:17:20.258 --> 00:17:22.838
So now, what should we do next?

00:17:23.478 --> 00:17:24.958
Should we move immediately?

00:17:26.088 --> 00:17:27.108
Wait a minute, don't.

00:17:27.798 --> 00:17:31.328
Let me investigate the facts first to be sure, then I'll tell you.

00:17:33.028 --> 00:17:35.658
What the hell? Still being complacent?

00:17:39.248 --> 00:17:40.328
Not okay at all.

00:17:41.008 --> 00:17:43.998
What if something dangerous happens to Miss Patty?

00:17:44.818 --> 00:17:46.788
Come on, follow my orders.

00:17:47.078 --> 00:17:48.308
Don't do anything yet, understand?

00:17:49.638 --> 00:17:50.798
Acknowledged.

00:17:51.128 --> 00:17:52.398
But don't be slow.

00:17:52.398 --> 00:17:55.238
Because if it's really a criminal, I won't let them get away.

00:18:08.788 --> 00:18:09.948
Want to go to the fitness center?

00:18:12.048 --> 00:18:12.918
Where are you guys going?

00:18:16.278 --> 00:18:19.758
Oh, there you are. Thought you disappeared.

00:18:23.438 --> 00:18:25.328
Why didn't you tell me you were going somewhere, junior?

00:18:28.328 --> 00:18:31.458
You know, if something happens to Miss Patty,

00:18:31.878 --> 00:18:34.068
can a bodyguard like you handle the responsibility?

00:18:35.708 --> 00:18:37.218
We weren't going far.

00:18:37.558 --> 00:18:40.218
I saw they have a fitness center here,

00:18:40.218 --> 00:18:44.898
so we were going to work out together, and have Alice teach some self-defense techniques.

00:18:45.268 --> 00:18:47.538
Huh! Have who teach?

00:18:48.548 --> 00:18:49.668
That junior?

00:18:50.628 --> 00:18:52.458
Yes, and what will you do about it?

00:18:53.808 --> 00:18:57.988
You can barely take care of yourself, how can you teach anyone?

00:18:58.488 --> 00:19:00.428
Why can't Alice teach me?

00:19:01.078 --> 00:19:03.998
I know Alice well, and we've been together a long time.

00:19:05.128 --> 00:19:09.638
Don't forget... yesterday Alice was the one who helped me.

00:19:10.308 --> 00:19:11.408
Achi, don't you remember?

00:19:16.258 --> 00:19:18.898
Better not. I don't trust her.

00:19:19.598 --> 00:19:21.418
I'll teach Miss Patty myself.

00:19:21.808 --> 00:19:24.588
As for that junior, go teach Chama over there.

00:19:26.938 --> 00:19:27.958
Where's Chama?

00:19:28.328 --> 00:19:29.518
I'll go get her.

00:19:29.838 --> 00:19:31.608
Wait here, don't go anywhere.

00:19:36.048 --> 00:19:36.838
What now?

00:19:39.308 --> 00:19:43.398
It's okay. Stay calm. I'll handle it.

00:19:43.908 --> 00:19:44.458
Okay.

00:19:46.388 --> 00:19:48.898
Chama! Chama!

00:19:54.948 --> 00:19:55.978
What is it, Achi?

00:19:56.908 --> 00:19:58.468
Go change. We're going to the gym.

00:20:00.768 --> 00:20:02.638
Why? I'm not going.

00:20:03.608 --> 00:20:05.388
Come on.

00:20:07.958 --> 00:20:10.478
Let's go to the gym. We'll be late.

00:20:15.918 --> 00:20:19.168
Why the rush? The gym isn't going anywhere.

00:20:19.638 --> 00:20:22.998
Hurry. Alice is going with Miss Patty first.

00:20:22.998 --> 00:20:24.078
So what?

00:20:24.078 --> 00:20:26.378
What's wrong with Alice going with Miss Patty first?

00:20:27.798 --> 00:20:29.048
Nothing.

00:20:29.388 --> 00:20:32.858
I just want to finish teaching the self-defense techniques,

00:20:33.248 --> 00:20:35.028
so I'll have time to do other things.

00:20:35.808 --> 00:20:37.988
Come on, Chama.

00:20:37.988 --> 00:20:40.278
Go change. Quick, go.

00:20:40.608 --> 00:20:42.088
Go change. We're going to the gym.

00:20:53.328 --> 00:20:55.548
I'll teach Miss Patty myself.

00:20:56.388 --> 00:20:58.118
And you, junior,

00:20:58.668 --> 00:20:59.798
you go teach Chama.

00:21:00.228 --> 00:21:03.648
Why won't Achi teach me?

00:21:04.098 --> 00:21:06.878
It's all the same whoever teaches, Chama. Go.

00:21:07.298 --> 00:21:10.838
Let the junior teach. She can teach too.

00:21:11.198 --> 00:21:13.168
Ah, you're taking Chama.

00:21:15.648 --> 00:21:17.978
And Miss Patty, I'll teach Miss Patty myself.

00:21:20.438 --> 00:21:21.108
Okay.

00:21:21.968 --> 00:21:24.028
Go teach far away. It's distracting.

00:21:24.738 --> 00:21:25.478
This way.

00:21:26.458 --> 00:21:27.858
We'll use this machine.

00:21:34.178 --> 00:21:36.818
Engage your core a bit.

00:21:37.018 --> 00:21:38.458
First position is...

00:21:41.228 --> 00:21:43.268
Next we'll learn shooting.

00:21:44.188 --> 00:21:45.798
Person or buffalo?

00:21:46.408 --> 00:21:47.498

Here.

00:22:21.566 --> 00:22:22.896
Hold tight.

00:22:24.006 --> 00:22:25.516
- Yes
- And sit up straight.

00:22:26.346 --> 00:22:28.346
And engage your core a bit.

00:22:28.526 --> 00:22:30.486
Correct.

00:22:30.486 --> 00:22:31.516
Adjust the weight a bit.

00:22:36.466 --> 00:22:37.426
One more time.

00:22:48.116 --> 00:22:49.946
Now let's try lifting this one.

00:22:50.506 --> 00:22:51.196
Mm.

00:23:03.546 --> 00:23:05.876
I think it might be locked.

00:23:11.306 --> 00:23:13.566
Hold here, Miss Patty.

00:23:13.986 --> 00:23:15.256
And lift yourself up.

00:23:19.616 --> 00:23:20.526
Here.

00:23:22.796 --> 00:23:24.956
Lift, lift. 1, 2.

00:23:25.946 --> 00:23:27.766
Yeah, this one.

00:23:29.486 --> 00:23:32.456
Wow, you're quite strong.

00:23:32.456 --> 00:23:34.156
Ow.

00:23:34.696 --> 00:23:36.696
This machine hurts the abs too.

00:23:38.166 --> 00:23:41.106
The treadmill should be easiest for us.

00:23:41.106 --> 00:23:43.326
Then should we try that side?

00:23:43.326 --> 00:23:44.736
Okay.

00:23:49.056 --> 00:23:50.216
Pretty good.

00:23:58.486 --> 00:23:59.716
Let's try this one too.

00:24:06.456 --> 00:24:07.436
This one isn't locked.

00:24:08.116 --> 00:24:10.086
Try, try this one.

00:24:11.176 --> 00:24:13.886
Then I'll go try it.

00:24:14.446 --> 00:24:16.766
That one's locked.

00:24:19.646 --> 00:24:20.826
Like this?

00:24:21.766 --> 00:24:24.716
Oh, it... should definitely be unlocked now.

00:24:26.956 --> 00:24:30.476
Then... let's start.

00:24:32.216 --> 00:24:34.026
How is it? Okay?

00:24:34.556 --> 00:24:35.596
Okay.

00:24:47.816 --> 00:24:49.256
First position is...

00:24:50.476 --> 00:24:51.566
Like this.

00:24:57.416 --> 00:25:02.736
Eh, I don't think that's right, Alice

00:25:03.846 --> 00:25:04.566
Really?

00:25:04.566 --> 00:25:06.756
Uh, like this?

00:25:11.396 --> 00:25:13.606
Oh yes. Yes, that should be right.

00:25:13.606 --> 00:25:14.256
Okay.

00:25:23.716 --> 00:25:26.876
But to be safe, better hold on.

00:25:28.826 --> 00:25:29.646
Yes.

00:25:36.366 --> 00:25:37.646
Alice.

00:25:38.146 --> 00:25:42.256
I think we should get something to drink instead.

00:25:42.806 --> 00:25:45.416
Seeing them is really irritating.

00:25:48.476 --> 00:25:49.206
Yeah.

00:26:05.516 --> 00:26:06.706
The order.

00:26:06.706 --> 00:26:09.706
One matcha latte, one Thai tea less sweet,

00:26:10.016 --> 00:26:12.686
and one latte, and one fresh milk.

00:26:13.086 --> 00:26:15.576
All with Pro Fresh milk please.

00:26:15.576 --> 00:26:16.346
Okay.

00:26:23.276 --> 00:26:27.266
We use Pro Fresh milk, ready-to-drink fresh milk, for every perfectly balanced menu item.

00:26:27.706 --> 00:26:31.116
This milk will enhance the flavor making the drinks even more delicious.

00:26:31.116 --> 00:26:34.256
Fragrant, rich, easy to foam, smooth fine foam,

00:26:34.256 --> 00:26:35.706
and stable for a long time.

00:26:54.006 --> 00:26:55.776
I told them to practice. Where did they go?

00:26:56.346 --> 00:26:58.836
Chama and I went to get drinks for them.

00:26:59.446 --> 00:27:00.986
Doing good gets no recognition.

00:27:01.276 --> 00:27:03.986
When you're not the favorite, everything you do is wrong, right?

00:27:07.246 --> 00:27:09.596
Here, Miss Patty's Thai tea less sweet.

00:27:10.536 --> 00:27:11.376

Here, Pro Fresh milk for senior.

00:27:17.566 --> 00:27:19.476
I'll take this coffee instead.

00:27:19.956 --> 00:27:20.376
Eh!

00:27:20.376 --> 00:27:22.436
And the milk, you drink it.

00:27:22.436 --> 00:27:24.606
Drink lots so you'll grow fast.

00:27:24.606 --> 00:27:27.056
How can that be? That cup is mine.

00:27:28.266 --> 00:27:30.866
Chama, didn't you say senior likes milk?

00:27:35.376 --> 00:27:37.866
Mm, refreshing.

00:27:43.626 --> 00:27:44.526
Hmm.

00:27:45.586 --> 00:27:46.676
It's delicious too.

00:27:47.486 --> 00:27:48.316
Drink lots.

00:27:50.396 --> 00:27:51.916
Go shower now.

00:27:52.476 --> 00:27:53.956

00:29:02.484 --> 00:29:04.284
No, I don't need to at all.

00:29:04.694 --> 00:29:06.374
I'd rather stay with Achi.

00:29:07.204 --> 00:29:09.504
Achi-Chama, Chama-Achi.

00:29:16.454 --> 00:29:17.534
Ow!

00:29:17.784 --> 00:29:20.634
I'm so tired and I still have to practice shooting.

00:29:21.954 --> 00:29:25.374
Person or buffalo? So diligent.

00:29:28.134 --> 00:29:29.774
And next is shooting practice.

00:29:29.834 --> 00:29:31.374
What am I going to do?

00:29:34.584 --> 00:29:35.524
I know.

00:29:36.104 --> 00:29:39.734
We don't have to focus on accuracy, we'll focus on looking good.

00:29:41.484 --> 00:29:42.384
Alright.

00:29:43.354 --> 00:29:44.204
Go.

00:29:47.004 --> 00:29:49.024
Kahr MK9 pistol.

00:29:49.024 --> 00:29:51.484
9mm Micro Compact.

00:29:51.484 --> 00:29:54.504
We chose this one because it's the smallest,

00:29:54.794 --> 00:29:57.584
convenient to carry, and just the right weight.

00:29:57.954 --> 00:29:59.874
Four gun safety rules:

00:29:59.874 --> 00:30:02.364
1. Check the weapon every time.

00:30:02.364 --> 00:30:04.494
2. Watch where the barrel points.

00:30:05.254 --> 00:30:07.874
3. Keep finger off the trigger.

00:30:08.094 --> 00:30:10.614
And 4. Be certain every time you shoot.

00:30:12.534 --> 00:30:13.484
Wait.

00:30:13.944 --> 00:30:17.084
Everything I just said, this gun,

00:30:18.174 --> 00:30:19.264
is not it.

00:30:19.704 --> 00:30:20.434
Oh!

00:30:20.804 --> 00:30:24.064
For safety, today we'll use this gun.

00:30:24.874 --> 00:30:26.314
Oh.

00:30:32.994 --> 00:30:36.174
Here, aim at the target and squeeze.

00:30:39.594 --> 00:30:42.654
Wow, so good, Achi! Hit the target perfectly.

00:30:42.914 --> 00:30:45.814
Holding the gun looks so cool too. Amazing.

00:30:45.814 --> 00:30:47.914
I'll shoot one more time for you to see.

00:30:51.754 --> 00:30:53.224
Hit again.

00:30:53.224 --> 00:30:54.534
Achi is so good.

00:30:58.334 --> 00:31:00.024
Your turn, junior.

00:31:02.384 --> 00:31:03.934
I think we shouldn't waste time.

00:31:03.934 --> 00:31:06.164
Should we shoot together?

00:31:08.424 --> 00:31:11.624
Come on, Miss Patty. I'll teach you.

00:31:11.624 --> 00:31:13.484
Oh, okay.

00:31:17.514 --> 00:31:18.334
Go ahead.

00:31:20.334 --> 00:31:22.534
Very good, Miss Patty.

00:31:22.784 --> 00:31:24.414
Hit the target perfectly.

00:31:28.754 --> 00:31:30.174
- Want to try?
- Try.

00:31:31.004 --> 00:31:33.054
Try it. We're bodyguards.

00:31:35.714 --> 00:31:37.414
Wow, beautiful form.

00:31:38.954 --> 00:31:39.944
But the target is over here.

00:31:40.884 --> 00:31:44.284
Oh, it's okay. We'll practice gradually.

00:31:45.074 --> 00:31:45.844
Try again.

00:31:45.844 --> 00:31:47.794
Let me try, let me try.

00:31:47.794 --> 00:31:49.484
Achi, help teach me.

00:31:49.484 --> 00:31:50.364
Ow!

00:31:52.234 --> 00:31:53.624
Chama.

00:31:55.784 --> 00:31:57.324
Try again. It's okay.

00:32:04.184 --> 00:32:05.434
I'm sorry, boss.

00:32:06.284 --> 00:32:08.484
I told you, didn't I, to be careful?

00:32:11.864 --> 00:32:12.744
Boss,

00:32:13.114 --> 00:32:14.944
but I was being careful the whole time.

00:32:15.484 --> 00:32:16.964
Careful my ass.

00:32:16.964 --> 00:32:19.594
Almost got caught, and you're still arguing with me?

00:32:21.114 --> 00:32:24.954
I always told you to watch from far away, don't let them catch you.

00:32:25.484 --> 00:32:29.934
Your only job is to report to me. Absolutely forbidden to show your face to them.

00:32:29.934 --> 00:32:33.264
But you messed up, so now what do you want me to do?

00:32:35.434 --> 00:32:36.634
Boss, boss.

00:32:37.064 --> 00:32:40.214
I promise, next time it won't happen again.

00:32:43.724 --> 00:32:47.414
If next time you disobey orders again, you won't make it to the police,

00:32:49.024 --> 00:32:51.124
because I'll send you to the underworld instead.

00:32:53.664 --> 00:32:54.644
Yes, boss.

00:33:08.074 --> 00:33:09.584
Go shower now.

00:33:10.064 --> 00:33:11.644
Are you going to sleep like that?

00:33:12.914 --> 00:33:13.654
Alice.

00:33:21.414 --> 00:33:23.934
Not dead yet. Still breathing.

00:33:28.074 --> 00:33:29.664
Why sleeping so deeply?

00:33:47.884 --> 00:33:48.714
Hey!

00:33:50.014 --> 00:33:51.244
What the hell?

00:33:53.904 --> 00:33:56.114
Such a burden. Help out, will you?

00:34:06.174 --> 00:34:07.444
- PIDE
- Huh!

00:34:08.604 --> 00:34:09.884
I think I want to quit.

00:34:11.034 --> 00:34:11.884
Hey!

00:34:12.884 --> 00:34:13.714
Why?

00:34:16.554 --> 00:34:18.224
I've been trying my best,

00:34:18.894 --> 00:34:21.284
but the boss keeps scolding me, always scolding me.

00:34:25.274 --> 00:34:26.124
Pop,

00:34:27.454 --> 00:34:30.284
if you mess up work, you just go to jail.

00:34:31.454 --> 00:34:32.354
You won't die.

00:34:33.664 --> 00:34:35.744
You know what the boss is like.

00:34:37.974 --> 00:34:41.544
If you go against the boss, he'll kill you.

00:34:47.134 --> 00:34:48.964
Can't get off the tiger's back once you're on.

00:34:54.414 --> 00:34:56.684
Go, let's go back to the boss.

00:34:58.694 --> 00:34:59.474
Let's go.

00:35:12.754 --> 00:35:13.604
Achi.

00:35:13.834 --> 00:35:15.624
What is it, Chama?

00:35:19.124 --> 00:35:20.554
Why did you wake up so early?

00:35:20.984 --> 00:35:25.874
Well... I wanted to open my eyes and see your face first thing.

00:35:27.484 --> 00:35:28.544
Really?

00:35:31.204 --> 00:35:35.404
Did you go running alone? Where's the other bodyguard?

00:35:36.124 --> 00:35:38.254
Should be awake. Probably showering.

00:35:39.714 --> 00:35:42.524
Then if you don't have anything else, I'm going.

00:35:43.624 --> 00:35:45.504
Wait, wait, wait!

00:35:45.964 --> 00:35:47.024
What now?

00:35:47.914 --> 00:35:49.864
Um... well...

00:35:49.864 --> 00:35:52.324
Miss Patty wants to eat in her room today.

00:35:53.384 --> 00:35:54.214
Why?

00:35:54.524 --> 00:35:57.554
Probably tired from yesterday.

00:35:58.024 --> 00:36:00.544
Then bring her congee too.

00:36:01.144 --> 00:36:03.334
Sure, I'll arrange it.

00:36:04.054 --> 00:36:04.904
But...

00:36:05.294 --> 00:36:08.684
I'm free to eat at the dining room with you.

00:36:09.154 --> 00:36:11.344
Don't you need to stay and look after Miss Patty?

00:36:11.344 --> 00:36:13.664
Well, she's in her room.

00:36:14.224 --> 00:36:16.624
But we're working, Chama.

00:36:16.934 --> 00:36:20.724
I think you should eat in the room with Miss Patty. It's safer.

00:36:21.724 --> 00:36:27.184
But... I want to eat with you, just the two of us.

00:36:28.094 --> 00:36:30.694
But I come to see you often anyway.

00:36:32.824 --> 00:36:34.694
You never come to see me at all.

00:36:36.284 --> 00:36:37.434
Know-it-all.

00:36:38.214 --> 00:36:39.564
Then I'm going.

00:36:49.614 --> 00:36:50.454
Hey!

00:36:52.544 --> 00:36:54.554
It's late. Still not awake?

00:36:55.824 --> 00:36:58.744
Junior, are you going to sleep all day?

00:37:01.244 --> 00:37:03.074
I said you can wake up now.

00:37:05.034 --> 00:37:06.894
Not waking up? Fine.

00:37:08.614 --> 00:37:10.084
Hey, get up!

00:37:10.084 --> 00:37:12.554
It's late.

00:37:14.904 --> 00:37:16.074
Why is your hand hot?

00:37:18.674 --> 00:37:19.394
Hey!

00:37:23.314 --> 00:37:24.674
Your body is burning up.

00:37:25.374 --> 00:37:26.094
Alice.

00:37:37.324 --> 00:37:38.324
Here.

00:37:40.164 --> 00:37:41.184
Thank you.

00:37:41.734 --> 00:37:44.414
Where are Achi and Alice?

00:37:44.734 --> 00:37:45.674
Haven't they come yet?

00:37:45.674 --> 00:37:47.154
Oh, they're in the room.

00:37:47.894 --> 00:37:48.664
Oh!

00:37:49.284 --> 00:37:51.044
Usually they should be taking care of us, right?

00:37:51.514 --> 00:37:53.234
And it's already time.

00:37:53.994 --> 00:37:55.184
Why so late?

00:37:55.804 --> 00:37:57.194
Should be late.

00:37:57.194 --> 00:38:01.124
And it's probably just Achi coming to look after us today.

00:38:03.144 --> 00:38:05.374
Why? Where's Alice?

00:38:06.384 --> 00:38:09.934
Alice is really sick. Very feverish.

00:38:10.414 --> 00:38:14.794
Achi just called to tell Chama, to have Chama look after Miss Patty first.

00:38:17.954 --> 00:38:18.914
Where are you going?

00:38:19.204 --> 00:38:20.834
I think I'll go see Alice.

00:38:21.924 --> 00:38:23.504
Shouldn't you eat first?

00:38:23.864 --> 00:38:25.484
No, I want to go now.

00:40:00.564 --> 00:40:02.474
Achi, wake up.

00:40:03.074 --> 00:40:04.664
What happened to my clothes?

00:40:05.704 --> 00:40:07.354
Well...

00:40:11.334 --> 00:40:13.484
Try to think carefully.

00:40:13.544 --> 00:40:19.074
During this time, who have you been with that makes you feel special or happier than before?

00:40:21.324 --> 00:40:24.814
Hey Achi! Why did you grab my hand and...

00:40:24.814 --> 00:40:26.684
touch your breast?

00:40:26.684 --> 00:40:29.054
Are you crazy? I wasn't thinking anything like that.
