Oh my.

00:01:57.959 --> 00:01:59.176
Why didn't you go to Liang?

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.080
It's not the right time yet.

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:06.280
The Xue family is still in crisis.

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.040
How's it going?

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:10.719
Young Master did well

00:02:11.279 --> 00:02:12.320
and exhausted all means

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.600
to win Emperor Jia's trust.

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:15.160
He might even cure him.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.679
Xue Youshou has infiltrated
Emperor Jia's inner circle

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:20.799
with two objectives.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.399
First, to buy time.

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:24.080
Secondly...

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.040
Could he have other motives?

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:30.839
(Xue Youshou is impersonating)

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:32.160
(your Young Master.)

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.679
(But I can't expose him yet.)

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:37.239
(Unfortunately, I can't recall)

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:39.119
(anything from our past.)

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:42.999
I was ordered

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:44.920
to kill your entire family.

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:46.360
But Young Master

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:48.920
suggested His Majesty avoid bloodshed.

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:50.719
Thus, it was postponed.

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:55.559
Emperor Jia was gravely ill.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.880
How is he doing?

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.999
Thanks to Young Master,

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:01.600
His Majesty has been improving.

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:04.959
So, the key to saving the Xue family

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.279
lies in fully restoring
Emperor Jia's health

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:10.040
so the Crown Prince
can inherit the throne.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:11.719
That's right.

00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:13.839
Young Master is struggling.

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:15.839
This can't last forever.

00:03:16.679 --> 00:03:18.679
You keep praising your Young Master

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:19.640
as if I'm not here.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.320
Why are you shouting?

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.119
I'm not shouting.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:25.799
I'm reminding you

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.119
that you also have me.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.839
(You only care about that imposter,)

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.880
(ignoring the real one before you.)

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.999
(Fine.)

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:34.559
(Helping him is helping myself.)

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:36.320
Two people are

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.239
better than one.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.239

Not yet.

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:15.160
There's more.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:20.719
Look.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.279

All here.

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:26.800
You'll look convincing

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000
in any of these.

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.440
Proficient in both Eastern
and Western studies.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.959
Let me remind you.

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:40.120
Keep your distance from Xue Youshou

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:41.640
in the palace.

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:43.359
Don't be exposed.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:46.680
I need your lecture?

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:47.680
Obviously you do.

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:49.760
You're making eyes

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.399
at each other.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.839
Watch it.

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.599
You're making eyes

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.359
at me.

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:06.159
Yeah.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:08.640
That's right.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.919
Because I like you.

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:12.399
Why else would I hide?

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:16.000
It blows our cover if others find out

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:17.800
I'm into you.

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.159
Smooth talker.

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:31.959
Are you abandoning me

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:34.560
because of him?

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.039
What's the next plan?

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.640
The plan

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:51.640
is...

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:52.440
There is none.

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:25.760
Your Majesty.

After a day and night of exorcism,

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.640
the stars indicate that

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:33.599
the evil influence

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.399
is mostly purged.

00:06:35.959 --> 00:06:36.399
Good.

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:37.279
Next,

00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:38.399
I'll help Your Majesty

00:06:38.399 --> 00:06:40.159
activate your vitality

00:06:41.159 --> 00:06:43.399

Can I

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.719
truly recover?

(to bring him inner joy.)

00:07:05.279 --> 00:07:05.839
Your Majesty.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.479
Observe this Western crystal sphere.

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:18.560
Why are you suddenly worked up?

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:19.784
Your Majesty,

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.519
I behold your extraordinary leadership

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.080
within the crystal's radiance.

00:07:26.159 --> 00:07:28.039
You shine like brilliant sunlight,

00:07:28.359 --> 00:07:30.640
casting glorious illumination
upon the masses,

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:34.000
earning natural reverence and devotion.

00:07:36.399 --> 00:07:37.919
Each decree you issue

00:07:38.359 --> 00:07:40.800
shapes the welfare of all living beings.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.159
Your wisdom and valor

00:07:45.959 --> 00:07:48.959
form the cornerstone
of our thriving nation.

00:07:49.919 --> 00:07:51.240
Really?

00:07:52.719 --> 00:07:53.279
However,

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:57.800
within this brilliance,

00:07:58.599 --> 00:08:00.479
I detect threads of concern.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.120
Your pursuit of perfection sets

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:08.599
unattainable standards.

00:08:09.039 --> 00:08:09.560
Naturally,

00:08:09.839 --> 00:08:11.440
this fuels your greatness.

00:08:12.399 --> 00:08:12.880
However,

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:14.880
excessive anxiety

00:08:15.359 --> 00:08:16.719
and relentless governance

00:08:16.959 --> 00:08:19.959
consume you day and night.

00:08:21.599 --> 00:08:23.440
You are absolutely right.

00:08:24.039 --> 00:08:26.200
Sleepless nights plague me.

00:08:27.839 --> 00:08:30.320
In this crystal's glow,

00:08:30.599 --> 00:08:32.160
I witness your passion

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.599
propelling you forward

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:38.520
toward greater glories.

00:08:43.879 --> 00:08:45.119
I will achieve

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:47.999
greater glories?

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.080
(Make him believe)

00:08:50.719 --> 00:08:53.440
(his reign will last millennia.)

00:08:53.959 --> 00:08:54.560
Your Majesty,

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.560
through this crystal's luminescence,

00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:59.879
I foresee your sovereignty

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:01.680
enduring as sunlight,

00:09:01.999 --> 00:09:03.040
inextinguishable.

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:04.800
It shall illuminate

00:09:05.759 --> 00:09:06.520
for a millennium

00:09:07.879 --> 00:09:08.759
and eternity.

00:09:09.959 --> 00:09:11.479
Your counsel

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:13.400
enlightens me.

00:09:58.839 --> 00:09:59.320
This...

00:10:02.959 --> 00:10:03.479
This...

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:06.560
This is way too heavy.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.200
You got this, Your Majesty.

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:02.400
Astounding!

00:11:04.959 --> 00:11:06.440
Your robust health is a blessing

00:11:06.719 --> 00:11:07.759
to the nation.

00:11:12.119 --> 00:11:12.999
Impressive.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:27.752
Young Master.

00:11:28.599 --> 00:11:30.119
You've spent hours here

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:31.160
examining shadows.

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:32.520
Is it a shadow play?

00:11:33.839 --> 00:11:34.239
No.

00:11:34.999 --> 00:11:36.320
It's a method of

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:38.160
Western divination.

00:11:38.719 --> 00:11:39.560
Fascinating.

00:11:39.999 --> 00:11:40.759
May I try it?

00:11:42.119 --> 00:11:42.560
Certainly.

00:11:42.839 --> 00:11:43.400
Come here.

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:46.680
Sit.

00:11:48.959 --> 00:11:50.280
Place your hand on the paper.

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:51.999
Now,

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.080
I'll trace

00:11:53.599 --> 00:11:55.359
the outline of your palm with ink.

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:08.639
What a leisurely time.

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:11.920
Who are you?

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:12.959
You're too old

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:13.879
to be excused

00:12:14.119 --> 00:12:14.959
for barging in.

00:12:15.359 --> 00:12:16.119
Take it easy.

00:12:16.599 --> 00:12:17.128
We're allies.

00:12:17.239 --> 00:12:18.359
She's not my ally.

00:12:18.639 --> 00:12:19.200
Indeed.

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:20.160
We're not allies.

00:12:20.359 --> 00:12:21.200
How rude of you

00:12:21.719 --> 00:12:22.800
to just barge in.

00:12:26.239 --> 00:12:26.800
Oh my.

00:12:31.479 --> 00:12:32.639
Put your swords away.

00:12:32.879 --> 00:12:33.520
It's freaky.

00:12:35.639 --> 00:12:36.879
Who is this young woman?

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:39.320
I asked Miss Hua

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:41.839
to examine Emperor Jia's remedy.

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:45.520
Does it really

00:12:45.999 --> 00:12:47.160
require physical contact?

00:12:47.359 --> 00:12:48.080
I was tracing

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:49.200
her palm outline.

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:50.440
Come and see.

00:12:51.359 --> 00:12:51.920
Sit.

00:12:53.639 --> 00:12:54.839
Put your hand here.

00:12:57.719 --> 00:12:58.759
Now I'll trace

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:00.599
the outlines of your palm.

00:13:10.999 --> 00:13:11.759
Do you have to

00:13:12.599 --> 00:13:13.879
be so close to me?

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.680
This is the key to the treatment.

00:13:37.639 --> 00:13:38.400
See anything?

00:13:39.959 --> 00:13:40.520
Look.

00:13:40.839 --> 00:13:41.680
Your fate

00:13:41.839 --> 00:13:43.839
is filled with twists and hardships.

00:13:44.359 --> 00:13:45.320
This means your life

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:46.839
is full of challenges.

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:49.479
But when facing adversity,

00:13:49.999 --> 00:13:51.040
you never retreat.

00:13:51.639 --> 00:13:53.320
You overcome every obstacle

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:54.680
with your wisdom.

00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:57.560
That's so accurate.

to you?

00:14:11.759 --> 00:14:12.959
You know the answer.

00:14:13.719 --> 00:14:14.400
Yeah.

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:17.280
Young Master matters

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:18.759
more than me now.

00:14:19.599 --> 00:14:20.719
But think carefully.

00:14:21.239 --> 00:14:22.639
Who is the most crucial person

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:24.759
in your life?

You're making things up,

aren't you?

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:02.959
Come on.

00:15:03.999 --> 00:15:05.200
That's the treatment.

00:15:05.479 --> 00:15:06.320
The key lies here.

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:09.080
You make up something
based on the other person's

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:10.200
reaction.

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:12.520
Xue Youshou is a master of deception.

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:13.320
He got this.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:17.759
Young Master is not like that.

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:20.280
People

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:21.440
change.

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:23.560
You haven't

00:15:23.839 --> 00:15:24.719
seen him for years.

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:26.879
Look at you.

00:15:27.239 --> 00:15:27.839
You have

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:29.639
become Emperor Jia's pawn,

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:31.479
nearly killing him.

00:15:32.599 --> 00:15:33.400
Meanwhile,

00:15:34.119 --> 00:15:34.759
he hid the fact

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:36.719
that he was Mr. Immortal,

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:39.119
proving he never trusted you.

00:15:39.479 --> 00:15:40.440
You'd better

00:15:40.959 --> 00:15:41.719
stay vigilant.

00:15:43.959 --> 00:15:45.400
He is simply cautious.

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:47.119
Unlike you,

00:15:47.759 --> 00:15:48.920
careless.

00:15:52.119 --> 00:15:52.639
Indeed.

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:56.040
I can't match him.

00:15:57.119 --> 00:15:58.160
That's why I willingly

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:00.239
withdraw from this love rival.

00:16:04.839 --> 00:16:05.560
Miss Hua

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:07.368
is Old Zhang's granddaughter.

00:16:07.759 --> 00:16:09.400
My grandmother introduced her to me.

00:16:10.119 --> 00:16:11.719
Now that you've found Young Master,

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:14.040
I won't pester you.

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:16.200
I won't be

00:16:16.599 --> 00:16:17.639
overbearing.

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:20.680
You still indulge in

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:22.879
romantic notions at this point?

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:24.520
I didn't

00:16:25.239 --> 00:16:26.040
hold anyone back.

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:27.599
Look.

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:29.200
I've found the remedy.

00:17:01.879 --> 00:17:02.440
Your Majesty,

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:04.480
look at your palm outline.

00:17:04.879 --> 00:17:06.800
A winding yet unyielding fate line

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:09.720
reveals a life full of challenges.

00:17:10.439 --> 00:17:12.879
But your willpower
surpasses ordinary people.

00:17:13.599 --> 00:17:15.199
A mere palm outline

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:17.520
reveals so much?

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:21.159
The line remains distinct

00:17:21.879 --> 00:17:22.919
when folded thrice.

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:25.960
That means, when facing peril,

00:17:26.359 --> 00:17:27.480
you never back down.

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:30.520
You overcome every obstacle
with your tenacious resolve

00:17:30.639 --> 00:17:31.439
and wisdom.

00:17:31.839 --> 00:17:33.080
With such a ruler,

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:37.040
the nation prospers and people rejoice.

00:17:38.919 --> 00:17:41.199
I've sacrificed immensely

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:46.560
for this nation.

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:00.040
Your Majesty,

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:02.080
keep it close to your heart.

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:03.720
This symbolizes

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:07.560
the realm lying firmly in your grasp.

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:39.960
Why do you seem so gloomy?

00:18:41.919 --> 00:18:43.000
This charade

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:44.720
is just for morale-boosting.

00:18:44.879 --> 00:18:45.639
What a fraud.

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:48.760
It's a necessary expedient.

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:52.480
Yesh.

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:54.679
Deception

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.359
isn't a sustainable path.

00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:57.800
Of course.

00:18:59.119 --> 00:19:00.480
Thank you for working

00:19:00.599 --> 00:19:01.520
with me.

00:19:02.679 --> 00:19:03.080
Right.

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:04.599
Have you imagined

00:19:05.159 --> 00:19:06.399
your desired life?

00:19:10.599 --> 00:19:11.199
I have.

00:19:13.639 --> 00:19:15.320
It's the Mid-Autumn Festival.

00:19:16.399 --> 00:19:17.520
It was on this very day

00:19:18.119 --> 00:19:18.919
that we parted.

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:21.119
We've finally reunited.

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:23.320
I won't part with you again.

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:22.439
From now on,

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:24.520
I wish to celebrate

00:20:25.439 --> 00:20:26.760
this festival with you forever.

00:20:28.599 --> 00:20:29.119
Young Master.

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:31.560
Let's focus on getting out

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:33.320
of trouble for now.

00:20:35.599 --> 00:20:36.119
Alright.

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:37.760
Here's a gift for you.

00:20:41.159 --> 00:20:42.919
You've been restless these days.

00:20:43.399 --> 00:20:44.040
I put some

00:20:44.439 --> 00:20:45.839
tranquilizing herbs in it.

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:47.119
Keep it with you

00:20:48.159 --> 00:20:49.000
to feel better.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:52.560
Thank you.

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:54.800
Trust me.

00:20:55.679 --> 00:20:56.480
We will eventually

00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:58.280
be together.

00:21:37.199 --> 00:21:37.864
Young Master.

00:21:39.119 --> 00:21:40.280
Happy festival.

00:21:42.839 --> 00:21:43.839
Wine among the flowers.

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:45.240
It's perfect for two people.

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:51.800
This is to you.

00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:57.800
Alright.

00:21:58.599 --> 00:21:59.119
Miss Hua.

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:06.359
To the moon.

00:22:07.199 --> 00:22:08.080
To our hometown.

00:22:09.159 --> 00:22:09.800
I toast

00:22:10.919 --> 00:22:11.839
to you, Miss Hua.

00:22:14.119 --> 00:22:15.119
That was lyrical.

00:22:16.879 --> 00:22:18.399
Why don't you drink first?

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:20.879
Alright.

00:22:31.119 --> 00:22:31.760
Young Master.

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:34.159
Why isn't your beloved one

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:36.240
celebrating this festival

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:37.520
with you?

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:42.119
Forget it.

00:22:43.839 --> 00:22:44.359
Let's drink

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:45.679
to the brilliant

00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:47.839
moonlight.

00:22:49.439 --> 00:22:49.919
Alright.

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:53.159
Cheers.

00:23:12.199 --> 00:23:12.960
Already?

00:23:20.159 --> 00:23:21.679
(Well, Xue Hexu.)

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:24.240
(I rushed to bring you food from home.)

00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:25.159
(But you are)

00:23:25.439 --> 00:23:27.080
(having so much fun with her.)

00:23:42.919 --> 00:23:44.080
(What a lecher.)

00:23:44.639 --> 00:23:45.839
(How dare you grope her?)

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:48.280
(She has feelings for you.)

00:23:48.599 --> 00:23:50.960
(So you just sweet-talked her.)

00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:02.280
Miss Hua.

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:05.159
I'm in love with someone.

00:24:07.159 --> 00:24:08.159
I'm not sure

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:11.080
whether she likes me.

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:12.800
But she is

00:24:13.439 --> 00:24:14.439
the love of my life.

00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:17.119
True love is worth cherishing.

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:20.240
You should keep your love

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:22.919
for someone who cherishes you.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:30.696
Why are you here?

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:35.000
Grandmother asked me

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:36.760
to bring you some food.

00:24:40.439 --> 00:24:40.919
Let's go.

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:44.879
Your favorite.

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:47.320
All I wish is to be with you

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:48.960
in a humble home.

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:50.240
I have you

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:51.399
and Grandmother.

00:24:55.159 --> 00:24:57.520
But Youshou is all alone.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:24:59.599
No wonder.

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:01.720
No wonder what?

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:05.520
(His drive is on another level.)

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:07.159
(His mind is hard to read.)

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:08.800
(Unless you're him,)

00:25:09.119 --> 00:25:10.480
(you can't figure out his plans.)

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:14.199
No wonder

00:25:15.839 --> 00:25:16.599
he'd rather die

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:17.879
than keep hiding.

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:23.480

00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:32.280

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:37.760
Where to?

00:25:41.679 --> 00:25:42.359
I want to visit

00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:45.080
where you and Young Master stayed.

00:25:49.679 --> 00:25:50.720
What for?

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:54.879
I want to know

00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:56.159
how I lost to him.
