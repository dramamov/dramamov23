00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.540
Then this place is a hospital?

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.670
Someone brought us here

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:14.750
and forgot that we were here.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:16.129
I may have been brought for treatment

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:17.580
after seeing the old
man's ghost in the mirror.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:18.460
Remember!

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.630
I wonder if the psychological treatment

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.540
would stop me from
seeing the ghost.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.750
The way you spoke to the patient...

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.460
Do you still want to work here?

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:26.880
Can you please tell me

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:27.880
what I'm doing here?

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:28.710
Alan, calm down.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.830
everything should go
according to the treatment plan?

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.830
If you still don't want
to tell me, then it's fine.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.080
But you can trust me.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.790
You're lying.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.210
It will pass, just like it has every time.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.210
What "every time"?

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:37.960
Tell me, Doc!

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:38.460
Mr. Alan, hurry.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.710
Follow me.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.500
Remember.

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:52.539
Come back to me.

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.170
Remember!

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:59.960
Remember.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.170
Come back to me.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.000
Remember.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:08.380
Alan.

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:09.419
Pete?

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.630
What are you doing here?

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:15.580
An...

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:18.079
An elderly nurse

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.130
brought me here.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.500
A nurse?

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:24.920
Yes.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.380
An elderly nurse's brought me here.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.130
Which of the nurses, Alan?

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:32.670
I'm not sure exactly.

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:34.920
She brought me here,

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:36.670
and then she disappeared.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:37.670
Alan.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:38.790
Tonight's my shift.

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.630
There's nobody else but me.

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:43.000
I said there was.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.040
She brought me here, and then she vanished.

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:47.420
Or...

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.630
Maybe she went inside that room.

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:50.829
I could hear someone yelling too, Pete.

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:51.829
Alan.

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.210
There's a patient resting in that room.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:56.750
And there aren't any elderly nurses

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:58.880
during tonight's shift.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.170
I said there was!

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.460
She really brought me here!

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.130
Alan, calm down.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.420
Alan...

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.130
Was there anything else you saw?

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:10.380
Nothing else.

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:13.170
I'll take you back to your room, okay?

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.500
Let's go.

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.710
Pete's told me about last night.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.920
You shouldn't wander alone at night.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:37.790
I know.

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.290
But someone really did lead me out of my room.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.329
Do you think I made it up?

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.329
Are you certain that it wasn't

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:51.170
another episode of sleepwalking?

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:53.079
There was

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:55.040
an elderly nurse

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.630
who walked into the room, called me,

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.130
and brought me out there!

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.210
It wasn't a dream, Doctor.

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.460
If you insist, then I won't argue.

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:14.750
So, may I ask?

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:16.920
Do you think this incident was related

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.329
to the ghost in the mirror sightings?

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.080
I don't know.

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.080
Are you still afraid of the old man in the mirror?

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:34.580
Alan.

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.000
It's because you were afraid to see,

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:39.750
so you..

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.420
saw the things you were scared of.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.500
Our brains are only capable
of functioning in a positive way.

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.580
Do you know what provokes

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.380
the thoughts in our brain the most?

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:52.330
I don't know.

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:54.750
Emotions.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000
That is,

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.460
if you keep getting scared

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.210
and want it out of your sight,

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.460
you will see it more frequently.

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.080
But, doctor.

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:08.790
If what you said was true,

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:11.920
then how could Pete

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:14.920
also see the old man?

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Come again?

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.170
Pete told me

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.750
he saw the old man following me.

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:27.170
which means

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.460
what I saw couldn't
have been an illusion.

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:34.540
When did this happen, Pete?

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.420
On that day, Doctor O took me to the cafeteria,

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.080
and we came across Alan.

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:42.290
That's it, the cafeteria.

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:45.170
It could have been

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:46.960
any other old man, right?

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:49.540
But...

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:50.460
Alan.

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:54.420
When you saw

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:55.580
the old man.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.250
I'm not saying that what you saw

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:00.290
wasn't a real thing.

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.290
But the visual

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:03.880
and interpretation processes

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:06.500
might have been what
caused you to see the old man.

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:08.380
Are you...

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:09.790
still with me?

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.250
I don't understand.

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:16.630
Let me give an example.

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:18.540
If I tell you

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.080
"Don't think about cats."

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.170
Try not to think about cats.

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:24.130
So?

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.040
Are you thinking about cats right now?

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:28.290
Get it?

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.170
This is why is said
our brains only function

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:32.000
in a positive way.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.630
Before we could stop thinking about cats,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.710
thoughts of them
would always come first.

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:38.580
Take a look at this.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:41.750
What do you see?

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:42.920
Eight lines.

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:46.420
How about now?

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:47.420
"Ant".

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:49.500
They are eight straight lines.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.040
Look.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:53.920
"A"

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.040
uses three lines.

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:56.290
"N"

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:57.170
three lines.

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:57.540
"T"

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:58.630
another two lines.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.000
The total is eight.

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:02.170
they just weren't arranged

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:04.170
in the same way as the first one I wrote.

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:06.500
What does "ANT" mean?

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:08.500
Ants.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.040
What are you visualizing
in your head right now?

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:17.830
I'm seeing the ants.

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:19.790
They're everywhere.

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:22.670
Here,

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:24.830
This one, we called it

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.420
"Visual Recognition"

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:30.040
It's the interpretation process

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:31.630
of the images our eyes perceive.

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:33.960
Simply speaking,

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.830
The visual process that
our eyes can perceive

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:38.170
is one thing.

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:40.630
When our eyes see,

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:42.130
they send signals to the brain.

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:43.580
Our brains

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.790
will then project how the
images we saw look like.

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:49.330
Then we'll be able to understand

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:51.880
what the images mean.

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:54.710
We use a different part

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000
of our brain.

00:07:58.920 --> 00:07:59.830
You get it, right?

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:01.790
I guess.

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:04.130
Alan, I believe that

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:06.250
you actually saw something,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.380
but you brain interpreted it as an old man.

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:13.380
And...

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:16.880
it might not be a ghost at all.

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:22.290
I would like you to practice with this.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:23.960
Try looking at them

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:25.540
from many different angles.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.960
So, can I go now?

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:35.000
Sure, make yourself comfortable.

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:44.080
Have you informed Pete
how important it is to be careful

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:46.170
with words when
speaking to the patient?

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.580
Dr.O has already told me.

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:50.170
I just didn't think it
through at the time.

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:51.170
Didn't think it through?

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:56.290
Explain to me how you
didn't think things through.

00:08:57.830 --> 00:08:58.630
Well,

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:00.630
Alan asked something
out of the blue.

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:01.960
I was unprepared

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:04.000
and hastily replied without

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.420
So, you've never considered
this a serious matter?

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:08.710
Everything we've been doing?

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:11.290
We hired you

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:14.750
because we noticed you were
an enthusiastic young man.

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:15.920
Alright?

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:17.420
Do not dissapoint us.

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:23.210
Anything else you said to Alan

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:24.790
that we don't know about?

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:26.830
There's nothing else, doctor.

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:30.000
I apologize to both of you

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:32.290
for causing complications.

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:36.540
I'd like to remind you,

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:38.420
every case here

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:41.130
is extremely delicate.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.420
From the outside,
it may seem normal.

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:46.210
But every word we say,

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:47.920
everything we do.

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:50.250
Our expression, our tones.

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:51.250
Our emotions.

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:52.580
They all have an impact

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:55.000
on our patients' trust.

00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:59.710
I need you to be more
considerative about your duty.

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:06.540
Dr.Nil.

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.040
Maybe Pete's too new for this place.

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:11.630
As for other matters,

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.710
Pete has never failed to fulfill his tasks.

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:17.290
It might have been my fault too.

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:25.210
I consider you to be in charge of him.

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:28.290
So if something happens

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.130
next time,

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.670
I'll need you to be responsible for it.

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:36.500
Yes, sir.

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:38.710
Don't let this happen again.

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:46.170
I know

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:47.630
what I did was wrong,

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:49.960
but he didn't have to be so harsh with me.

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:52.880
Right?

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:54.750
Hey.

00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:56.540
What's that look on your face?

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:58.040
You think I had it coming?

00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:01.380
What makes you say that?

00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:04.330
Dunno, I just wanna vent on someone.

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:21.630
Hey, you.

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:23.750
Come on.

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:26.460
We all made mistakes.

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:28.460
Hmm?

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:30.080
Mm-hmm.

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:32.750
I'm sorry

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:35.210
for getting you into trouble.

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:54.500
A terrified man.

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:01.250
Dead people's graveyard.

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:09.330
A clock.

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:22.420
This isn't that hard.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000
An old person.

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:40.380
Remember.

00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:42.170
Come back to me.

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:44.040
Remember.

00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:46.290
Remember!

00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:14.290
Remember.

00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:30.830
What happened, tell me.

00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:33.420
It showed up again

00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:35.290
in the mirror right there.

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:37.790
You got a good look at it?

00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:41.170
Remember.

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:44.580
Remember.

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:46.830
If you won't come out,

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:48.960
then you'll be staying here with me all night!

00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:50.170
Get the hell out here!

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:54.630
Remember.

00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:58.250
Remember.

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:01.330
Remember.

00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:10.130
I can't take this anymore.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.500
I need to face him

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:16.920
and ask him what he wants from me.

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:41.920
Alan.

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:44.460
Alan.

00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:47.580
What's up.

00:14:57.630 --> 00:14:58.920
What are you doing?

00:14:58.960 --> 00:14:59.960
Leave me alone.

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:02.790
You left me last time.

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:05.540
When was that again?

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:07.040
Are you playing dumb?

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:10.130
I was referring to the night
the nurse ghost took me away.

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:11.880
You know?

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.580
Everytime something happened,

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:16.000
you were always gone.

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:17.420
I was scared shitless.

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:19.000
Come on, dude.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Don't touch me!

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:21.670
Hear me out.

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:23.830
I never wanted to leave you.

00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:25.580
Was that a reason

00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:26.750
or just an excuse?

00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:29.000
I know you're thinking I'm making an excuse,

00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:31.380
but please hear me out first.

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:34.880
If I really didn't care about you,

00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:37.170
why would I bother trying to explain?

00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:42.250
Let's hear it then.

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:44.500
I already went out looking for you.

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:46.710
But when I got there, I couldn't see you.

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:50.040
You really did?

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:51.960
You're not lying?

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:52.710
Yeah,

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Why would I do that?

00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:57.040
I didn't see you or anyone else there.

00:15:58.170 --> 00:15:59.540
Besides, that place was so dark.

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:00.710
Freaking terrifying.

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:03.000
I could get scared too, you know that?

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:05.670
I'm still feeling goosebumps right now.

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:08.500
Is that all you need
to get goosebumps?

00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:12.290
Wasn't even close to what I've seen.

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:15.380
Or...

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.830
Is baby Alan afraid of ghosts?

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:20.000
Stop.

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:21.380
Stay where you are.

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:24.330
I'm still mad at you, okay?

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:40.540
Still scared of mirrors?

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:43.540
Yeah,

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:45.170
because you left me.

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:47.830
I'm sorry.

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:51.580
What's this?

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:55.580
The cards.

00:16:58.540 --> 00:16:59.960
Dr.Nil told me practice

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:03.710
the Vi..Visual

00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:05.920
Visual Recognition.

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:08.750
But, I don't think it work.

00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:11.960
"Visual"?

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:13.540
They're just cartoon cards.

00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:16.920
But there's actually
something off about this place.

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:19.710
You also were just terrorized
by the ghost of a nurse.

00:17:23.579 --> 00:17:24.579
I've got an idea.

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:25.790
I'll help you find out

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:27.040
about that nurse.

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:29.170
Consider this an apology.

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:33.290
Find out, how?

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:35.880
Come, follow me.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000
Hey, wait!

00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:37.880
Win.

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:42.460
What about me?

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:44.580
Just climb down after me.

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:45.460
Is it that hard?

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:46.040
Hurry.

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:48.080
I'm not doing this.

00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:51.130
I'll just meet you downstairs.

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:53.380
Asides from ghosts,

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:54.790
you also scared of height?

00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:57.420
How old are you now?

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:02.960
Come on.

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:04.920
Quick.

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:08.330
Whatever.

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:11.830
Is this the right way?

00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:12.960
It's this way.

00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:22.290
Careful.

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:24.630
I've been climbing here every day.

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:30.170
I...

00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:31.210
Easy.

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:33.500
I'm not gonna make it.

00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:35.210
Not possible.

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:36.630
Got it, come quickly.

00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:54.630
See?

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:56.330
I told you it's dangerous.

00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:57.080
Jerk.

00:18:57.130 --> 00:18:58.130
You're the one who's careless.

00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:01.380
Careful.

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:24.330
So

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:25.710
how did you know about this place?

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:27.830
I've never known

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:29.920
there's a place like this.

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:32.250
Block one was the first building here,

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:33.960
so its state now is a bit old.

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:39.210
My room is around this wing.

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:41.880
Sometimes I like to
come down for a walk.

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:44.920
A walk?

00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:49.710
This place is really scary.

00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:51.830
What makes you think it's
okay to walk here alone?

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:57.630
I haven't seen anyone around here.

00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:01.460
When the new buildings were built,

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:04.080
no one used this place anymore.

00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:06.330
As a result,

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:08.130
the atmosphere is rather creepy.

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:10.580
Let alone patients,

00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:13.710
even nurses are reluctant to
come here unless necessary.

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:16.920
I've heard

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:19.170
they're planning to demolish it soon.

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:23.790
They're just waiting for
another founder to die first.

00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:25.290
Another founder?

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:29.040
Who is he?

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:32.500
There were two doctors.

00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:36.250
One has died,

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:40.630
and the other is very old.

00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:47.460
You sure knows a lot.

00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:49.000
Who did you hear that from?

00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:50.920
Everyone's been talking about it.

00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:57.250
Did you hear something?

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:01.040
Hear what?

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:07.080
Someone's coming this way.

00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:38.830
This is awkward.

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:43.960
I should move a bit.

00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:18.330
Let's move.

00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:10.330
Hey.

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:15.500
Check this out.

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:17.630
I don't think there are any
other nurses apart from this.

00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:19.130
You find her?

00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:22.580
No, nothing.

00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:29.210
What's this board.

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:32.380
A Memorial

00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:34.420
to the Hospital Founding Day?

00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:39.420
Memorial board for honoring

00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:41.630
all previous staff members
who have passed away.

00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:45.750
All of the photos are in sepia.

00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:48.040
That's why they were called Memorial.

00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:08.290
What's wrong?

00:24:11.670 --> 00:24:12.670
That's her.

00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:15.080
That's the nurse ghost.

00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:16.250
In the middle.

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:18.500
That's her.

00:24:18.670 --> 00:24:19.670
That one.

00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:21.210
Who's there?

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:25.960
What do we do?

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:27.250
Run!

00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:32.710
You...

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:33.920
Let's go!

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:35.880
Let's go!

00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:37.500
Are you okay?

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:38.500
Hey!

00:24:38.670 --> 00:24:39.670
What are you doing?

00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:41.540
Let go!

00:24:41.670 --> 00:24:42.670
Let me go!

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:45.500
Win!

00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:48.710
Win.

00:24:50.170 --> 00:24:51.170
Win.

00:24:56.130 --> 00:24:57.080
Could you walk me through

00:24:57.130 --> 00:24:58.710
how you got there?

00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:06.580
Before asking me,

00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:08.710
you should tell me

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:10.920
who that nurse ghost was?

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:12.380
That nurse's been dead.

00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:16.040
I saw her picture on that board.

00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:18.040
You better tell me the truth.

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:20.170
I've never seen that nurse before.

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:23.580
Never had memories of her in my brain.

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:25.460
So,

00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:27.250
how could she not be a ghost?

00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:29.250
Don't try to hide it from me.

00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:32.500
Are you sure

00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:36.130
you've never seen this nurse before?

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.460
Have you never?

00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:40.880
And

00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:43.420
are you also sure that

00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:45.580
you've never forgotten anything?

00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:49.630
Sure you've never seen her?

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.000
Alan.

00:25:53.250 --> 00:25:55.460
You have an issue with memory.

00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:58.080
Maybe you've seen her

00:25:58.080 --> 00:25:59.040
in the past,

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:00.670
but you just couldn't to remember.

00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:02.170
Am I right?

00:26:03.210 --> 00:26:04.500
Try to think slowly,

00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:06.630
perhaps you'll be able to remember

00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:08.460
that you've met her at some point.

00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:10.380
Let me ask you again.

00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:12.750
How did you get yourself in that building?

00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:23.710
I don't know.

00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:34.170
If something happened,

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:37.170
you can let me know.

00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:40.330
I'd like us to be more trusting.

00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:46.500
Do you know what's the most
important thing about treatment?

00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:49.330
I don't know.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.290
Please just give me the answer.

00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:54.420
It's the doctor and patient relationship.

00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:56.040
The trust between a patient

00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:57.080
and a doctor.

00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:59.500
That's what's most important.

00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:04.130
You see, if a patient

00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:05.330
does not trust a doctor,

00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:07.210
the treatment will fail regardless.

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:11.880
Do you wish to no longer be afraid?

00:27:15.670 --> 00:27:17.000
So, if you wish to get better.

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:18.880
From this moment on,

00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:21.790
would you please trust me?

00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:33.000
Tell me the truth about everything.

00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:34.880
If I do that,

00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:38.380
will I be normal again?

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:45.040
You will.

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:18.500
Do you

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:20.580
have something to say to me?

00:28:21.790 --> 00:28:22.790
I don't.

00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:25.960
I just have the feeling

00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:28.250
that you are waiting for

00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:29.670
someone to sit with you.

00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:33.170
May I join you?

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.000
Sure,

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:38.040
please have a seat.

00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:44.880
I'm Si.

00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:47.580
I'm Alan.

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:48.920
Have you

00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:51.000
been here a long time?

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.000
Yes.

00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:58.080
Have your family,

00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:00.580
friends,

00:29:02.130 --> 00:29:04.250
or other people ever come to visit you?

00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:08.420
I once had a husband,

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:11.460
but he died a long time ago.

00:29:16.210 --> 00:29:18.460
But he never goes anywhere, actually.

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:21.920
What...

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:23.420
did you mean?

00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:25.960
I can still feel

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:27.580
that he's right here,

00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:31.830
so much so

00:29:32.170 --> 00:29:34.170
that I get confused sometimes.

00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:38.250
Confused,

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.000
you say?

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.670
When two people

00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:47.830
were the only ones in each other's lives

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:50.250
and one of them

00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:53.580
had to pass away,

00:29:55.250 --> 00:29:57.000
the other would be left

00:29:57.170 --> 00:29:58.750
with an empty space

00:29:58.790 --> 00:29:59.790
inside the house

00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:02.420
until they started to question

00:30:03.170 --> 00:30:04.960
if they were ghosts

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:07.290
or dead people.

00:30:07.670 --> 00:30:08.790
So it's not them,

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:09.790
but us,

00:30:09.790 --> 00:30:13.330
who have been sent
to an afterlife world.

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:15.460
Do you believe that

00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:18.540
you have been dead?

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:24.040
It's not like that.

00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:25.580
I was just

00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:28.540
using metaphors to describe loneliness.

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:33.750
You must be very lonely.

00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:38.000
Being lonely is one part.

00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:41.540
It's the pain of missing someone.

00:30:42.290 --> 00:30:43.290
The pain

00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:44.960
of missing someone?

00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:49.040
One of my senior

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:50.040
once said

00:30:51.290 --> 00:30:54.040
The sadness that was caused by missing someone

00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:56.960
was the receipt that time had given.

00:30:57.790 --> 00:30:59.750
The more we missed each other,

00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:01.040
the more it meant that

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:02.380
the times we shared together

00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:04.330
were filled with joy.

00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:09.170
Sorry

00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:10.790
you had to listen to

00:31:10.790 --> 00:31:11.920
my meaningless rant.

00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:15.210
Not problem at all.

00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:16.540
I actually liked it.

00:31:17.670 --> 00:31:19.420
My senior came up with it,

00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:20.460
just like I said.

00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:24.000
That senior of yours was a very wise man.

00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:26.460
Amazing use of the metaphors.

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:28.080
Yes,

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:29.920
he was very wise.

00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:40.460
Have you ever felt lonely?

00:31:48.330 --> 00:31:49.330
I don't know.

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:53.290
What about you?

00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:56.330
If we had someone special,

00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:00.380
regardless of where they were,

00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:02.750
we'd always miss them,

00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:04.830
yearn for them.

00:32:06.170 --> 00:32:07.380
When we weren't seeing them,

00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:10.460
our hearts broke.

00:32:13.710 --> 00:32:15.330
Have you ever

00:32:15.630 --> 00:32:17.500
missed someone?

00:32:25.670 --> 00:32:27.540
There's one person, actually.

00:32:30.210 --> 00:32:32.080
But I don't know where he went.

00:32:34.290 --> 00:32:35.580
Where did he go?

00:32:37.290 --> 00:32:39.040
Would you mind if I ask?

00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:41.750
Sure you can.

00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:47.170
Honestly, I don't really know

00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:48.920
he went.

00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:53.420
If this were to happen to you,

00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:55.330
would you be mad?

00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:57.790
if someone suddenly left you?

00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:01.250
Sometimes

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:04.460
it was hard

00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:08.670
to embrace the goodbyes.

00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:12.960
But the people who left

00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:16.750
might have had their own reasons.

00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:22.080
If you get the chance to ask,

00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:26.580
then you better ask them,

00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:30.630
so you wouldn't have to regret

00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:32.500
not asking, like I did.

00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:36.670
Mr. Alan, Ms. Si.

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:38.290
Now's the time to return to your room.

00:33:39.670 --> 00:33:41.330
I'm about to do so.

00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:53.290
What's that sound.

00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:11.540
Oh.

00:34:12.630 --> 00:34:13.790
And I thought you were a ghost.

00:34:17.290 --> 00:34:18.290
You hungry?

00:34:18.830 --> 00:34:19.830
I see you're looking for snacks.

00:34:21.670 --> 00:34:22.920
I was a little hungry,

00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:24.540
so I checked the refrigerator

00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:25.830
to see what was there to eat.

00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:28.330
Then,

00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:30.290
should I make you a sandwich?

00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:33.790
Would that be okay?

00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:37.080
We have to try.

00:34:45.170 --> 00:34:45.630
Come.

00:34:58.790 --> 00:35:00.420
How hungry are you?

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:03.130
Not too much.

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:04.670
Just a little bit.

00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:10.420
Here you go.

00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:17.250
Thanks.

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:31.080
Are you afraid of ghosts?

00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:32.920
When you switched on the light,

00:35:33.290 --> 00:35:34.210
I noticed

00:35:34.250 --> 00:35:35.630
your face was really pale.

00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:38.920
No.

00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:42.130
I'm not scared.

00:35:49.130 --> 00:35:49.830
Oh.

00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:51.670
Are you sleepy?

00:35:54.290 --> 00:35:55.750
You're on shift tonight.

00:35:56.500 --> 00:35:58.330
Why didn't you get enough sleep?

00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:01.830
I had something on my mind,

00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:04.670
so I couldn't sleep.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.000
Don't tell me

00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:09.170
you've been feeling down

00:36:09.210 --> 00:36:10.460
since the doctor scolded you.

00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:17.210
Yes.

00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:23.460
Pete.

00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:25.790
In the workplace,

00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:29.500
Anybody can make mistakes at any time.

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:31.250
You don't need to overthink it.

00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:34.040
How am I supposed to stop overthinking?

00:36:34.830 --> 00:36:36.880
If you were chastised for a mistake at work,

00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:38.750
wouldn't you overthink it.

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:41.040
Given what the doctor said,

00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:42.500
when I came to think of it

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.540
I may have really worsened
the patient's condition.

00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:47.920
Listen to me carefully.

00:36:50.170 --> 00:36:52.960
The treatment we've been carrying out

00:36:54.250 --> 00:36:55.580
is uncertain as to

00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:58.250
whether we've taken the correct path.

00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:01.710
As for you,

00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:04.000
You were flawed

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.670
in not doing as the Dr.Nil ordered

00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:08.210
but you were not flawed in being a nurse.

00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:13.630
You genuinely cared about the patients.

00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:15.420
Understand?

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:17.920
Yes.

00:37:22.830 --> 00:37:24.000
Since you're sleepy,

00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:25.750
how about this?

00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:27.710
Wanna recharge our energy?

00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:30.380
Recharge the energy?

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:32.330
What do you mean, doc?

00:37:33.210 --> 00:37:34.210
What do I have to do?

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.000
Alright.

00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:38.960
Stand up.

00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:42.460
Come on, stand up.

00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:43.460
We really doing this?

00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:45.710
What..

00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:47.080
what is this?

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:48.960
A free hug.

00:37:49.830 --> 00:37:50.830
You have no idea what this is?

00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:55.040
Hey,

00:37:55.130 --> 00:37:56.330
stop being shy.

00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:59.000
I've hugged Doctor Nil too.

00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:02.790
Okay.

00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:23.580
Thank you.

00:38:28.210 --> 00:38:29.580
That definitely made me feel better.

00:38:30.830 --> 00:38:31.460
So,

00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:33.670
you feel awake now?

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:35.880
I would say

00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:37.920
the best way to rest

00:38:38.290 --> 00:38:39.960
is to take a nap.

00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:43.670
Tell you what,

00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:45.330
I'll go get my documents

00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:47.210
and report papers to work here.

00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:48.500
I'll be right back.

00:38:48.830 --> 00:38:49.750
Alright.

00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:51.500
Then I'm going to

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:52.880
take a little nap.

00:39:49.380 --> 00:39:50.380
Go away.

00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:52.750
I need to talk to you.

00:39:53.250 --> 00:39:54.460
I'm not talking to you.

00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:56.960
You should go.

00:39:58.670 --> 00:40:00.250
Can you open this for me?

00:40:09.170 --> 00:40:10.170
What do you want?

00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:14.170
I know you're mad at me

00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:17.130
but please hear my reasons out.

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:19.580
Stop.

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:21.920
Stay where you are.

00:40:22.830 --> 00:40:24.290
Don't come inside.

00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:29.960
When I left you that day,

00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:35.040
I never wanted to leave you.

00:40:35.210 --> 00:40:36.460
I had reasons

00:40:37.210 --> 00:40:38.920
for leaving so often.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.000
Please understand.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.000
What reasons?

00:40:45.830 --> 00:40:46.830
explain now.

00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:51.960
I've caused trouble,

00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:56.000
so the doctors and the nurses

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.500
keep an extra eye on me.

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:01.210
If I get caught,

00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:05.790
I have no idea how they will punish me.

00:41:06.830 --> 00:41:09.170
Worst case, they might detain me

00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:11.920
and prevent me from seeing you ever again.

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:12.880
Time's up, Win.

00:41:17.130 --> 00:41:18.920
I gave you one minute,

00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:22.920
but I haven't a single sorry from you.

00:41:26.130 --> 00:41:27.130
Stop.

00:41:27.250 --> 00:41:28.250
I've had enough.

00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:30.380
I'm sorry!

00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:32.790
That's enough,

00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:33.790
go away.

00:41:33.830 --> 00:41:34.830
Get lost.

00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:37.460
Get out.

00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:39.380
I'll say it to you as many times as you want.

00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:40.330
But

00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:41.500
can you please talk to me?

00:41:42.130 --> 00:41:43.420
Get out.

00:41:45.170 --> 00:41:45.960
Alan.

00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:47.500
Get out.

00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:51.500
Win!

00:41:59.130 --> 00:41:59.500
Win!

00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:21.920
Alan?

00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:23.540
Alan.

00:42:30.580 --> 00:42:31.630
Where are you going?

00:42:32.290 --> 00:42:33.790
No going outside at night.

00:42:34.210 --> 00:42:35.210
Do you remember?

00:42:38.330 --> 00:42:39.080
Well,

00:42:39.130 --> 00:42:41.040
I lost my photo cards,

00:42:41.290 --> 00:42:42.580
so I'm out here looking for them.

00:42:43.170 --> 00:42:44.170
Photo cards?

00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:46.290
You can look for them tomorrow.

00:42:48.540 --> 00:42:50.000
I need to find them now.

00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:52.580
If Dr.Nil sees them tomorrow,

00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:53.880
I'm going to be in trouble.

00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:55.670
Strange,

00:42:55.830 --> 00:42:58.580
I've never seen you take
the photo cards out to play.

00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:02.380
Alan.

00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:09.500
I've never encountered
a situation like this before,

00:43:09.630 --> 00:43:11.000
so I'm not sure what to do.

00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:12.040
Yes.

00:43:15.330 --> 00:43:16.330
I'm so sorry.

00:43:17.290 --> 00:43:17.880
Win.

00:43:21.670 --> 00:43:22.670
Win.

00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:24.580
Win!

00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:26.710
So you cared about me after all.

00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:29.920
Win?

00:43:31.330 --> 00:43:32.380
Are you hurt?

00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:40.960
You seem all right.

00:43:41.790 --> 00:43:42.790
Just as I thought.

00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:45.290
You made a really good run there.

00:43:46.290 --> 00:43:47.290
Are you no longer mad at me?

00:43:49.630 --> 00:43:50.630
Who says I am?

00:43:51.830 --> 00:43:52.420
Let go.

00:43:52.670 --> 00:43:53.790
Let go.

00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:55.040
I said let me go!

00:43:55.130 --> 00:43:55.830
Let go.

00:43:56.330 --> 00:43:57.330
I did.

00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:07.540
Idiot.

00:44:07.790 --> 00:44:08.790
That was all your effort?

00:44:09.790 --> 00:44:10.790
Sorry.

00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:16.960
You're not mad at me anymore?

00:44:19.130 --> 00:44:20.130
No.

00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:27.080
You're not mad anymore?

00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:36.000
You were so mean to me.

00:44:40.210 --> 00:44:41.210
You know

00:44:41.830 --> 00:44:43.330
how worried I was

00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:44.670
when you were gone?

00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:46.540
I'm here now.

00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:49.380
I never wanted to leave you.

00:45:05.250 --> 00:45:06.880
I climbed the windows to see you,

00:45:08.210 --> 00:45:10.130
avoiding the doctors and the nurses

00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:14.790
all because I wanted to be with you.

00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:23.500
But I had to leave that day

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:26.750
so I could see you again.

00:45:30.790 --> 00:45:32.130
Did you mean

00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:36.330
you would disappear like this again?

00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:40.790
Mm-hmm.

00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:44.580
But even if I disappear,

00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:48.080
I will always come back to you.

00:45:48.670 --> 00:45:49.670
Okay?

00:45:54.330 --> 00:45:55.330
Promise me

00:45:56.580 --> 00:45:58.040
you'll always come back for me.

00:46:00.130 --> 00:46:00.790
Mm-hmm.

00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:02.380
I promise.

00:46:09.830 --> 00:46:11.000
You promised?

00:46:12.170 --> 00:46:13.170
Mm-hmm.

00:46:13.330 --> 00:46:14.330
Got it.

00:46:21.330 --> 00:46:23.500
Don't ever leave me like this again.

00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:27.750
I won't go anywhere.
