Mengmeng,

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.630
do you know?

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.270
Everyone is a star in the sky.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.340
Then which one are you?

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.110
The brightest one is me.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.990
When I'm not by your side,

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.830
the brightest star
will keep you company.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.180
What if I want to talk to you?

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.420
Just call out my name

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.550
to the brightest star.

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.270
If it is twinkling,

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.740
it means I've heard you.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.830
Then you can talk to me.

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.830
Mom, is that you?

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.300
Yes.

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.140
Mom,

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.110
is it you?

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:49.670
Mom,

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.700
I don't want you to turn into a star,

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.700
but I'll be good.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.020
Good girl.

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:13.580
Mengmeng,

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.300
promise me one thing.

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:18.580
What is it?

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.270
Treat Auntie Hong as your mom.

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:27.270
Why?

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.990
When I'm not by your side,

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.510
Aunt Hong will take care of you.

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.110
She will treat you as well as I do.

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.830
Can you also treat her as your mom?

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.990
What if I want you to promise that?

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.550
I hope you will grow up happily,

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:08.580
meet good people,

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:12.700
and live a long life,

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.140
okay?

Danshun.

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:01.260
What's wrong?

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:05.670
I want to eat cotton candy.

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:07.470
Will you buy it for me?

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:10.420
Now?

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:14.590
Okay.

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:16.350
I'll go now.

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:25.550
Danshun.

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:42.030
The keys.

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:47.590
You'll be at home, right?

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:49.420
Go back and rest.

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:12.790
Here, take it.

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:15.910
You can only have one more.

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:25.230
Two cotton candies.

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:26.590
Okay, one for five yuan.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:35.590
Does it stick to your teeth?

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:38.230
- Tasty.
- Is it sweet?

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:40.670
Try mine.

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:45.350
You can't eat anymore, okay?

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:46.190
Okay.

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:48.590
Look, you've eaten this down so small.

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:51.230
Shall we lift you?

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:52.870
Sure.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:56.530
Hold my hand.

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:58.350
Let me lift you high.

00:06:58.590 --> 00:06:59.790
One, two, three, fly.

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.060
Are you happy?

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:05.620
Did you eat it today?

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:07.990
Hurry up.

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:08.950
Okay.

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:35.910
I'm back, Zhang Yan.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:19.110
Zhang Yan?

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:02.660
Zhang Yan.

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:07.430
Zhang Yan.

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:16.430
Danshun,

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:18.070
please forgive me.

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:21.310
I don't have the courage
to leave in front of you,

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:23.800
so I chose to leave
without saying goodbye.

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:28.070
The first time you took me
to Zhuyun Temple,

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:30.430
you bought cotton candy for each of us.

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:32.950
You treat yourself

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:35.020
and others like a child.

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:37.190
It makes me feel very special

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:38.310
and happy.

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:40.950
That was actually
the first time I tasted

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:42.310
the flavor of cotton candy.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:44.740
I will never forget it.

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:47.780
Later, we fell in love.

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:49.900
I realized you truly have
a loving heart.

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:54.380
To this day, I still feel

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:55.900
I'm so lucky to have met you

00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:59.020
and fallen in love with you.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.660
A monk from Zhuyun Temple once told me

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:07.190
that people in this world

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:09.430
can't let go of many things.

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:11.380
But the journey of life

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:13.190
is about letting go little by little,

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:16.780
or the burden will be too heavy
for them to go on.

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:20.430
What you and Hong did for me

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:23.430
was help a dying person
lay down a heavy burden

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:25.530
and let go of attachment
to the mortal world,

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:27.780
so I can go on living

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:28.860
and loving others

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:30.780
as Mengmeng's mother.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:35.500
I am very grateful.

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:37.500
Danshun,

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:40.020
those cotton candies are for you.

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:43.380
Your days are still long.

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:46.020
(Alprazolam Tablets)
Whether you remember me or forget me

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:47.020
doesn't matter.

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:49.430
No matter what,

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:50.950
keep going.

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:53.540
If it feels too bitter,

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:56.430
have a bite of cotton candy.

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:19.950
What day is it today?

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:21.380
Why make it so grand?

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:26.780
The 150,000 you lent me

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:27.900
is all on the card.

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:29.430
You can have it back.

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:34.900
What about the surgery?

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:37.740
I'll still have one,

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:39.540
but I won't be using your money.

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:43.780
What does this mean?

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:47.620
It doesn't mean anything.

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:51.780
Ma Weicheng,

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:54.430
let's break up.

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:00.140
I've given the money back to you.

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:01.950
We're even now.

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:07.630
You don't have to look at me like that.

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:11.430
I know that in your heart,
I'm a casual woman

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:13.380
who doesn't deserve love.

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:15.020
What are you talking about?

00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:16.620
I've never said that.

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:18.660
But that's exactly what you think.

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:21.140
Do you still love me?

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:22.070
I love you.

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:23.620
I've always loved you.

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:24.660
What do you love about me?

00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:33.140
Lin Chang,

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:36.900
on the first day
you appeared in this alley,

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:39.070
you were drenched all over.

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:40.780
I felt that you were very pitiful.

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:43.380
Then you said you wanted
to go to Haizi Cliff.

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:44.780
I didn't even tell you

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:46.540
that I pulled some strings.

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:49.140
Only then were we able to walk in
through that small path.

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:51.620
On that cliff, you said

00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:53.600
you wanted to find someone to rely on.

00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:55.140
At that moment, I made up my mind.

00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:56.900
I really wanted to protect you.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:00.740
You told me you have heart disease.

00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:02.540
I tried every possible way

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:04.660
to find the best doctor to treat you.

00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:10.070
I even managed to find 150,000 yuan.

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:11.900
It wasn't easy for me.

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:17.190
I think loving someone

00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:19.430
means giving everything I have to them.

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:22.900
That's exactly how I treated you.

00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:28.140
So, that's what you've been thinking.

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:42.780
I know

00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:45.140
you've been mad lately.

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:48.310
Let's just be open about it.

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:49.740
Don't be upset.

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:50.580
Okay?

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:55.740
So touched.

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:00.310
You won't end up

00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:02.020
moving yourself while acting, right?

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:10.500
I really want to ask you:

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:12.140
Every time you talk to me

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:14.190
so affectionately,

00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:15.500
do you think you are

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:17.260
especially affectionate,

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:18.860
handsome,

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:20.430
and charming?

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:22.900
Any woman would be
completely captivated by you,

00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:24.380
right?

00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:27.430
What do you mean
by giving unconditionally?

00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:28.770
Wasn't this 150,000 lent to me?

00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:30.260
If it's lent, shouldn't it be repaid?

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:31.740
How is that unconditional?

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:33.900
The things you did

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:35.260
were just to make me listen to you,

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:36.460
so you can control me, right?

00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:38.150
Also,

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:39.310
you love me?

00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:40.950
You love me, so you hit me?

00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:42.500
What kind of nonsense is that?

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:43.430
Don't lie to me

00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:45.020
in the name of love, okay?

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:46.900
- Stop talking.
- Why should I?

00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:49.780
You can't handle it now?

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:54.020
Do you really think women are

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:55.900
all stupid enough to be fooled by you?

00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:57.020
Listen.

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.430
They didn't get fooled
because of stupidity

00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:00.620
but kindness.

00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:02.260
But I'm not kind.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:03.430
What can you do?

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:15.380
What else can you do
besides hitting women?

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:19.430
When you were punched by Mr. Wang,

00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:20.580
you didn't even dare to fart.

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:22.150
I told you to stop talking.

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:24.260
Let me talk!

00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:28.020
You're nothing outside.

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:30.020
All you do is hit women at home.

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:32.740
What right do you have
to look down on me?

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:35.070
Why can't you just listen to me?

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:37.430
Ma Weicheng,

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:39.260
you're a useless man.

00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:01.190
My medicine.

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:03.180
I...

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:04.310
My heart disease medicine.

00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:05.660
Don't pretend with me.

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:09.020
My medicine.

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:12.740
My medicine.

00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:15.380
Today,

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:16.500
if I die here,

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:18.310
you

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:19.340
will be

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:20.620
a murderer.

00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:24.190
Give me the medicine.

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:30.780
Where is your medicine?

00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:57.860
Wait here.

00:16:58.310 --> 00:16:59.620
I'll go get the medicine.

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:00.780
Just wait here.

00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:10.820
(Tiantai'an Health Products)

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:19.260
There is a back door
at Ma Weicheng's house.

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:20.870
After he leaves,

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:23.060
go around through the alley at the back.

00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:15.380
(Tiantai'an Health Products)

00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:27.230
Let a speculative and selfish coward

00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:29.890
choose the path we want him to take.

00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:31.100
Lin Chang, have your medicine.

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:31.940
Here.

00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:35.100
Too easy.

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:39.430
This is the choice

00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:41.190
Ma Weicheng will definitely make.

00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:42.910
(Tiantai'an Health Products)

00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:44.390
Zhang Yan knew him too well

00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:48.190
and predicted his every move,

00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:51.630
including disposing of the body.

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:38.150
We

00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:41.500
never found Zhang Yan's body.

00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:45.060
Is it because Ma Weicheng

00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:48.060
disposed of the body at Haizi Cliff?

00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:49.990
Haizi Cliff

00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:57.630
is a place carefully chosen
by Zhang Yan.

00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:00.300
The tide rises there at night.

00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:02.100
Anything thrown down there

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:03.630
will sink into the sea.

00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:07.580
When the tide recedes during the day,

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:12.150
even the reefs will be exposed.

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:19.230
We kept following Ma Weicheng.

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:21.740
At the break of dawn,

00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:23.990
we pulled Zhang Yan out.

00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:28.340
Where did you hide the body?

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:36.990
She's been laid to rest.

00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:51.190
Do you

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:54.820
really believe

00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:58.870
that Qin Hong can keep living

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:02.190
as Zhang Yan?

00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:17.150
That was Zhang Yan's final wish.

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:40.900
(People's Police)

00:21:57.990 --> 00:21:58.450
Chief Liu,

00:21:58.470 --> 00:21:59.840
the colleague watching Feichuan

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:00.970
found out that he arranged

00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:02.250
for a ship to go to sea.

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:04.060
Going to sea during the fishing ban?

00:22:05.150 --> 00:22:06.470
Is he trying to leave the country?

00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:08.100
There's another matter, Chief Liu.

00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:09.630
The colleague tailing Ma Weicheng

00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:10.950
lost track of him.

00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:17.740
Notify the Coast Guard to move now.

00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:18.580
Yes.

00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:32.180
Zhou.

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:33.940
Ma.

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:35.710
You really managed to slip out.

00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:38.290
How do I get in touch with your friend?

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:40.230
Ma, that's not very decent of you.

00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:42.530
You told me you ran into some trouble

00:22:42.530 --> 00:22:43.430
and had to leave.

00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:45.100
You never said this was about a murder.

00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:47.430
Don't talk nonsense.

00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:49.430
I didn't do that.

00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:51.150
Otherwise, why would I be here?

00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:54.580
You're so lucky.

00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:56.670
There happens to be a ship going out.

00:22:58.190 --> 00:22:59.190
If you can't come back,

00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:00.870
your store...

00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:04.090
I'll transfer it under your name.

00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:10.870
You didn't kill her, right?

00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:35.300
Hurry up.

00:23:57.500 --> 00:23:58.580
Get on the ship.

00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:01.390
If there's anyone

00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:02.430
who asks about me...

00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:03.630
Get on the ship.

00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:04.710
Please.

00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:06.470
From now on, you and I

00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:07.340
will be even,

00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:08.920
and so will Zhang Yan and I.

00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:11.740
Thank you on behalf of Zhang Yan.

00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:13.870
Come on, Mengmeng.

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:18.430
Be careful, little girl.

00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:33.390
Hey, who is it?

00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:53.910
Find a room yourself.

00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:16.670
Go over there.

00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:35.190
Auntie, where are we going?

00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:39.190
We are going to a very faraway place.

00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:40.910
Are you scared?

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:45.070
Well.

00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:46.100
Take a nap,

00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:47.390
and you won't be afraid anymore.

00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:48.300
Then we'll be there.

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:49.190
Alright?

00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:51.300
I also have a secret weapon.

00:25:52.910 --> 00:25:54.500
This is a bravery candy.

00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:55.390
After eating it,

00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:56.580
you won't be afraid anymore.

00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:57.420
Give it a try.

00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:00.510
Okay?

00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:22.390
Oh, you're a friend of Zhou?

00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:24.470
- Hey.
- Go on.

00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:25.310
Come on.

00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:26.430
Go on.

00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:27.750
- Alright.
- Fu.

00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:57.530
Hey,

00:26:57.550 --> 00:26:58.820
are there still beds available?

00:26:58.910 --> 00:26:59.870
Go find one yourself.

00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:26.750
Hong.

00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:28.670
I beg you.

00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:31.630
Only you can help me.

00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:33.710
What about you?

00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:34.670
Go, go!

00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:36.420
Go!

00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:09.550
Mengmeng,

00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:11.430
I'll go out and take a look.

00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:13.910
Hold the little bunny
and sleep first, okay?

00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:15.940
Remember this:

00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:17.470
You can't go with anyone except me.

00:28:17.470 --> 00:28:18.310
Alright?

00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:19.430
Promise me.

00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:20.530
Come on, let's pinky swear.

00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:24.710
Go to sleep.

00:30:59.330 --> 00:31:00.500
How did I not think of that?

00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:02.150
You and Zhang Yan were in cahoots.

00:32:00.150 --> 00:32:01.150
Foolish women.

00:32:01.530 --> 00:32:02.390
One died in vain.

00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:04.150
And one will die at my hands today.

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:14.180
(Police)

00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:48.900
Help! Help!

00:32:49.390 --> 00:32:50.700
No! No!

00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:51.670
Help!

00:32:57.990 --> 00:32:59.150
Help!

00:32:59.390 --> 00:33:00.230
Help!

00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:04.070
No!

00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:06.870
Help!

00:33:10.670 --> 00:33:11.520
Don't kill me.

00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:12.670
Don't kill me; I was wrong.

00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:13.710
I was wrong.

00:33:18.670 --> 00:33:19.670
Police! Don't move!

00:33:19.950 --> 00:33:20.990
Hands on your head! Squat!

00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:22.030
Don't move!

00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:23.470
Stop running! Stop!

00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:24.310
Don't move!

00:33:24.670 --> 00:33:25.680
- Come out!
- Come out!

00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:29.670
Don't move!

00:33:30.150 --> 00:33:30.990
Qin Hong.

00:34:30.990 --> 00:34:31.980
Hurry, go

00:34:34.910 --> 00:34:35.830
- Hurry.
- Hurry.

00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:37.550
Hurry, hurry.

00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:53.540
Mengmeng?

00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:23.310
Sorry.

00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:33.870
I owe you this.

00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:35.620
For Kaifu.

00:36:46.350 --> 00:36:48.620
The law will give you a fair verdict.

00:36:56.470 --> 00:36:57.950
We all know about you

00:36:57.950 --> 00:36:59.310
and Zhang Yan now.

00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:03.060
You must believe in the law.

00:37:03.350 --> 00:37:04.750
It will punish Ma Weicheng.

00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:07.470
It will not let Zhang Yan down.

00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:09.180
After running for so long,

00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:11.060
I am tired.

00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:14.180
You've been looking for me for so long.

00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:19.430
You must be tired, too.

00:37:28.350 --> 00:37:29.270
Fortunately,

00:37:30.310 --> 00:37:31.700
we both feel at ease now.

00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:51.460
Mengmeng,

00:37:56.020 --> 00:37:57.910
I couldn't fulfill the promise

00:37:58.990 --> 00:38:00.430
I made to your mom.

00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:02.020
I'm sorry.

00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:05.430
I can't be there to watch you grow up.

00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:16.270
This is the place.

00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:26.470
(Combustion-style revenge)

00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:28.700
(can push the enemy into a sea of fire)

00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:30.220
(and also devour)

00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:33.620
(those beautiful memories
once buried inside.)

00:39:33.910 --> 00:39:35.470
(Even if Lyu Danshun, Qin Hong,)

00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:36.430
(and even Mengmeng)

00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:39.060
(could gain a moment of peace,)

00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:41.620
(they could not escape this ending)

00:39:41.830 --> 00:39:44.060
(when recalling Zhang Yan.)

00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:46.430
(From the very beginning,)

00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:47.870
(it was destined to be)
