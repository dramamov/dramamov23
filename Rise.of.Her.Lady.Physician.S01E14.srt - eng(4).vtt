00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:16.880
Wait a minute!

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.440
I have something to say.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.640
Go ahead.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:21.920
What are your last words?

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.960
I concealed the plague

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.800
because I was worried it might

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.920
lead to chaos.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.040
Ridiculous!

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.200
How could you disregard

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.040
the regulations and put

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.880
the palace at risk?

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.320
Lord Wu,

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:33.640
this woman is eloquent

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.520
and good at manipulating.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.760
She shall be burned immediately!

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.640
Lord Feng is absolutely right.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.880
She must be punished!

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.120
Minister Wu,

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.320
Minister Feng,

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.800
Su Ye's pox marks have formed scabs,

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.800
showing signs of recovery.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.120
Why must she be burned
according to the regulations?

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.040
As healers,

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.680
we bear the duty of saving lives.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.400
In the imperial palace,

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.680
are the regulations
more important than human lives?

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.600
Lord Wu,

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:58.680
as a physician,

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.480
can you truly disregard human lives

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.040
and go against your conscience?

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.280
Rong Zelan.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.200
Stop your sophistry.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.320
Who are you to question
the palace regulations?

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.160
Since ancient times,

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.760
whenever there's a plague,

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.280
the patients should be
burned and buried deep immediately

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.680
to prevent its spread.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.080
If I let you go

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.240
and cause the smallpox to spread,

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.280
who could be responsible
for such a catastrophe?

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.520
You're all healers.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.440
Do you truly believe it is right
to disregard human lives?

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.320
Smallpox may be dangerous,

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:32.960
but with careful treatment,

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:33.880
it can also be cured.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.840
Why not try to treat it?

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.120
When someone is infected,

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.600
you burn them without hesitation.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.360
What if there are
hundreds or thousands of them?

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.720
Are you going to burn them all?

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.080
You'd rather watch
the patients burned to death

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.040
than try to save them.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.360
Are you truly worthy of
the title of healer?

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:55.640
Your Majesty,

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.360
I agree with Attendant Rong.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.680
As physicians,

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:59.880
we should strive to save people.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:00.880
A plague is scary,

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.430
but we shouldn't avoid it forever

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.440
and burn every patient.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.280
If the patient is cured,

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.080
we will gain valuable experience,

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.480
which will benefit

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.640
the nation and the people.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.160
Your Majesty, please

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.920
give her a chance to treat the illness.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.480
I'll keep an eye on them

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.520
and make sure they don't leave the room.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.960
If the treatment fails,

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.200
I will

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.600
burn them immediately

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.760
to ensure everyone's safety.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.920
- That's right.
- Yes.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.300
Yes.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.400
That makes sense.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.360
She has a point.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.600
Maybe we'll find a way.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.440
Shut up!

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.840
The regulations must not be violated!

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.040
Light the fire!

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.160
Stop!

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.240
Rong Zelan,

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:51.680
it's only been a few days.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.320
How could you cause trouble again?

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:54.800
Do you know

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.440
what crime it is to question
the palace regulations?

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.600
Your Majesty,

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:59.640
I do.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.360
But what I said

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.480
is also for the sake of
the nation and people.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.200
Your Majesty, you love the people

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.120
and govern with benevolence.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.120
How could you bear to see
the innocent die?

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:11.720
If this goes on,

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.520
what will the people say?

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.880
They'll despise the Imperial
Medical Bureau for watching people die

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.280
and sighing that the ruler
disregards human lives.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.000
Moreover,

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.000
witnessing the imperial physicians

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.120
being burned to death,

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.520
they'll doubt
if there's any safe place in the world!

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.840
Your Majesty,

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.560
she is exaggerating.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.280
Your Majesty!

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.160
If the soldiers on the frontier

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.920
and the farmers in the fields

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.520
hear that you watched
physicians being burned to death,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.960
they wouldn't dare
to entrust their lives to the court.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.280
Prescriptions Worth
a Thousand in Gold says,

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:45.880
"Human life is above all."

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.080
Your Majesty,
you govern with benevolence.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.400
If such a precedent is set,

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.520
what will the history books say
a hundred years later?

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.480
Perhaps, "The emperor, to preserve
the peace of the inner palace,

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.360
destroyed his reputation
for benevolence."

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:57.600
How dare you?

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.320
Your Majesty, she is threatening you.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.640
Your Majesty, I wouldn't dare!

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.160
I'm just concerned

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:05.720
that if the words spread,

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.720
the discussions among the officials

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.560
and the condemnation of all the scholars

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.160
would surely tarnish
your sacred reputation.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.400
You're quite sharp-tongued.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.360
The rules, though strict,

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.080
are for the security of the nation.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.320
How could I risk everyone's safety

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.440
for the survival of one person?

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.920
So, does it mean

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.880
you believe that sacrificing one
to save the others is only natural?

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.040
The country is like a giant ship.

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:32.800
Sailing through stormy waves,

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.200
it must cast off burdens.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:36.840
If I were to plunge the people

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.160
into danger because of one person,

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.240
that would truly be
a betrayal of all the people.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:43.880
How could an attendant know

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:45.880
the governance balance?

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.880
You compare the state to a ship,

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.560
yet fail to see that its foundation
lies with the multitude.

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.760
If you abandon the people for the ship,

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.600
you'll lose the trust of the people.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.200
Even with immense power,

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.280
the ship will still go down.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.440
A great physician

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.560
safeguards the people's hearts,

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.160
and the emperor guards the realm.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.840
Shouldn't you cherish human lives
even more than a healer does?

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:09.560
Are you certain

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:11.800
you can cure smallpox?

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:13.680
I am certain!

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.800
Your Majesty, don't trust her!

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.920
Rong Zelan is not an imperial physician.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.320
Even an imperial physician
cannot guarantee success.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.080
She is merely a medical attendant

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.240
and doesn't deserve
to heal and save people.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.640
Nor does she have any experience.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.480
She's just bragging

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.360
to save herself!

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:32.320
Your Majesty,

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.080
please allow me to take Su Ye into
the side room for Isolation Treatment.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:36.720
If I fail to cure

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.640
the smallpox in ten days,

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.880
I'm willing to die
to atone for the crime

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.160
without any complaint!

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.000
If I can cure

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.640
the smallpox in ten days,

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.040
there will be an excellent remedy
for saving lives,

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.440
and your reputation
for benevolence and generosity

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.120
will spread throughout

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.320
the land.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.160
Your Majesty,

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:57.760
this is a strategy that saves all!

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:59.640
Your Majesty,

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.400
I'm willing to test the medicine.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.480
If I can make a contribution
to the people,

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.160
I would die without regret!

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:07.760
Okay.

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.080
Then I'll

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.760
give you ten days.

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:13.640
Thank you, Your Majesty!

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.880
Rong Zelan.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:30.840
You're not

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.160
an impulsive person.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:33.480
Why did you ask about

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:34.960
sacrificing one to save the many?

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:36.400
Did something happen?

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.040
Su Ye got smallpox.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:41.640
According to the rules,

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.000
when there's a plague,

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:44.400
the patients shall be burned.

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:46.720
I'm not going to report it.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:49.760
Will you expose me?

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:52.120
Are you sure you can cure her?

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:54.640
Yes.

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.320
But I suspect that someone set this up

00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.600
to get rid of me.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.680
So, you intentionally
led me to discover this.

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:07.920
Yes.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.560
Now that you're aware of this matter,

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.120
we are on the same boat.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.080
What do you want me to do?

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.000
I have a plan.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.040
Though dangerous,
it can certainly turn the tables.

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:23.600
Lord Song, when they find out

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:24.760
that I get smallpox,

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.720
please invite His Majesty
to the bureau.

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:34.600
It is difficult.

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:37.600
That's why I'm asking for your help.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:39.840
I believe you can do it.

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.040
In addition,

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.360
I'd also like to ask you
for three matters.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:48.200
First,

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:49.880
help me confirm

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:53.040
if my roommates, Zhou Ning and Sun Yu,
have been infected.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:54.760
Second,

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:56.720
I need medicine to treat smallpox.

00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:58.120
Third,

00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.720
please find a way

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.640
to make sure no one

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.560
comes near the quarantine room.

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.000
Why do I keep falling into your traps?

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:17.380
(Imperial Medical Bureau)

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.320
Zelan, drink the medicine.

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:30.680
Come on.

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:34.520
Are you alright?

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:36.600
I'm fine.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:38.440
Su Ye,

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.560
we'll definitely get through this.

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:41.400
Yes.

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:42.720
Zelan,

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.880
after hearing what you said
to His Majesty,

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:46.360
I really admire you.

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:48.120
I also want to be as brave as you

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.440
and fight for what I want.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:54.880
Su Ye,

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:57.320
if I can't get through this,

00:08:58.160 --> 00:08:59.000
remember to prepare

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.480
the medicine according to
the prescription I taught you

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.200
and keep drinking it.

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:04.720
Remember,

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.400
from now on, you must live for yourself

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.800
and your medical skills.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.680
And, if possible,

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:15.080
you must live for all the women

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:16.390
who never

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:19.200
had a chance to rise as men do.

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:21.520
Okay.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:23.160
Zelan, I got it.

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.120
I want to be a bird
that flies over the walls.

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.240
No one can trap me in a cage again.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.160
Come on.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:35.440
Be careful.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:44.400
(It's been ten days.)

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.040
(Rong Zelan,)

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.240
(you must be safe and sound.)

00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:59.480
Lord Feng, what's this about?

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.560
Officer Song, why are you here?

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:07.720
By order of Minister Wu,

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:09.880
I'm here to provide herbs
for Attendant Rong.

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:11.560
But Lord Feng,

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:12.880
what brings you here?

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:14.800
The deadline for Rong Zelan

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:17.400
to treat smallpox is approaching,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.220
so I'm here to check on the situation.

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.440
If she's still plagued by the sickness,

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:24.520
I will act in accordance
with the regulations

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.480
and finish the two of them on the spot.

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:30.560
Rong Zelan and His Majesty
had a deal of ten days.

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:32.680
There's still an hour left.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:34.560
Lord Feng,

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:36.600
aren't you a bit too hasty?

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:40.280
The room is in a deadly silence.

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:41.800
Perhaps they've

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:43.240
already died.

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.480
Lord Song, you're still trying
to win her an hour.

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.400
Are you really expecting her

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.000
to come back to life

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.160
in an hour?

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.320
Whether I believe it or not
is not important.

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.240
I only know that whoever

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:57.800
defy the imperial decree

00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:58.960
must die!
