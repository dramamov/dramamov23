[Episode 26]

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.280
Qingtong.

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.750
As long as the whole world believes

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.470
that you killed them,

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.030
by then,

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.079
Qianji City will be your only refuge.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.860
The shape of this wound...

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.240
Could it be…

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:56.430
Lady Hero,

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:57.240
this…

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.440
this was left by the killer.

[Wangquan Shouren will die
on the night of Frost's Descent.]

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:13.470
Ridiculous.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.800
There's no way
this could've been done by Fugui.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.730
Because the murdered Master Ximen

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.079
and Elder Shouren
mentioned in the killer's message—

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:23.400
the thing they had in common

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.910
was that they'd both
opposed Senior Fugui before.

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.110
So now rumors are spreading everywhere

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:29.800
that Senior Fugui
has returned for revenge.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.120
I believe in him.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.740
He'd never do such a thing.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.350
What else have you found out?

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.750
Master Ximen's Achilles' tendons
were severed by someone.

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:39.810
That sword mark...

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.190
seems familiar.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:45.890
It looks like...

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.400
Like what?

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.079
The work of the Dust-Seeker Sword.

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:57.760
The Dust-Seeker Sword?

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:59.960
I remember—that sword

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.090
was a gift from Fugui to Miss Qingtong.

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:03.560
Master,

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.730
could it really be them?

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.800
We must get to the bottom of this.

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.360
Fugui and Miss Qingtong
must not be falsely accused.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.000
Also,

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.160
the most urgent thing now

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.560
is to send people
to protect Elder Shouren at once,

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.420
in case something happens to him.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.480
Okay.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.590
Foolish.

[Invitation]

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.830
Why hold a banquet at such a time?

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:34.560
Master,

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.560
why hasn't your condition improved yet?

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.360
Didn't the physician say
it was just a common cold?

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:42.430
It's fine.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.170
I'll be better soon.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.920
Go handle what I told you.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.830
Huaizhu,

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.930
I just wanted our Fugui
to live an ordinary life.

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.680
But now he's caught up in chaos again.

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:06.630
If your spirit is watching over us,

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.560
please grant me a little more time.

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:09.750
Right now…

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.720
I can't go to see you yet.

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:25.180
[Night Hotel]

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.140
Pour some tea for me.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.130
Here you go, Master.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.040
Tasty.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.600
The tea is bitter. You don't like it?

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.390
Well, right outside,

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:55.750
there's a steamed bun shop.

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:57.350
Just turn right out the door.

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.909
Then

00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:59.440
I'll go get you some.

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:00.160
Alright.

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:12.390
I'm a spider demon from the Silk Cave.

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:13.750
Greetings, Soldier.

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.750
The matter
I asked Madam Yin to investigate—

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:16.870
how's it going now?

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.480
Madam has kept sending people out

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:20.940
to look for Miss Qingtong.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:21.830
Unfortunately,

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.430
she still hasn't been found.

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:25.750
Though Miss Qingtong's whereabouts
remain unknown,

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:26.560
recently,

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.510
something major happened
in the Yiqi Alliance,

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:30.170
and it concerns you, Soldier.

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:36.800
The entire Ximen family was slaughtered.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.390
The killer even left a message,

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:41.990
saying they'll kill Wangquan Shouren
on Frost's Descent night.

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.760
When did this happen?

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:44.930
Just a few days ago.

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:46.800
Master Ximen

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:47.920
and Elder Shouren

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:49.800
both had grudges against you.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.930
People all believe you're the killer.

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.240
The rumors are everywhere.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.510
They say you ordered
the demon at your side—

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:57.070
Miss Qingtong—to do it.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:58.950
Elder Shouren,

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:00.810
to prove his conscience is clear,

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.000
has openly invited heroes from all around

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:03.920
to the Wangquan family's

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.450
Frost's Descent Banquet
three days from now.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:08.240
Thank you.

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.210
The scent of that person...

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.400
why does it feel so familiar?

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:45.730
Elder Shouren,

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:48.270
the killer still hasn't been found.

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:50.159
By hosting the Frost's Descent Banquet,

00:07:50.159 --> 00:07:51.800
aren't you unnecessarily
complicating things

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.200
and increasing the risk?

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:58.020
You're worried about retaliation,
aren't you?

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.120
Everything I, Wangquan Shouren, have done

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.510
has been for the Yiqi Alliance

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:04.910
and the Wangquan family,

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:05.950
not…

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.240
for myself.

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:11.600
Why should I fear retaliation?

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:14.070
Elder, there is no need
to speak out of spite.

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:16.560
Senior Fugui couldn't
possibly be the killer!

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:17.190
If it's not the Soldier himself,

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:18.950
then it's one of his followers!

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:23.560
Anyway,

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:27.040
the invitations for the banquet
have already been sent.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.800
If Wangquan Hongye values his reputation,

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.669
he'll have to protect me at all costs.

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:33.440
You...

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:34.360
What?

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:42.390
I'll assign more guards

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.340
to protect you, Elder.

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.680
But before Frost's Descent,

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.670
no guests should be allowed inside.

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:51.790
Don't worry.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.600
Most of them

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:55.480
are staying at the Night Hotel.

00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:59.630
The Night Hotel?

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:04.720
Miss, your tea.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.790
Why have the drinks gotten even pricier?

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:08.920
That's ridiculous!

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.360
It's all because of Elder Wangquan

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.220
and his Frost's Descent Banquet.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.440
Who on earth
killed the Yiqi Alliance's family masters?

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:17.120
Yeah.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.200
Isn't it obvious?

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:19.670
It was the Soldier.

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:22.360
He and that spider demon by his side

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:23.550
did it together.

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:24.750
All those murdered family masters

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:26.840
once wanted the Soldier dead.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:28.840
To take revenge, the Soldier

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.320
first severed their meridians

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.150
and then killed them to silence them.

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:33.150
Do you have proof?

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:35.600
You can't just make wild accusations.

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:36.910
There will be soon.

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:38.080
Master Ximen's body

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.280
is currently stored in Huntian Prison.

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:42.250
They're bound to find proof there.

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:44.850
I don't believe it.

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:46.080
What's so special about that prison?

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.030
Very special.

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.000
Let me put it this way for you:

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.120
any case

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:51.630
that reaches Huntian Prison

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:52.890
will surely be solved.

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:56.150
Master,

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:57.800
eat it while it's hot.

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:04.370
Have you noticed

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:07.410
something's really off about this place?

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:10.050
Don't look.

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:12.480
Right now, the entire Yiqi Alliance

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.610
thinks I killed those family masters.

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:16.870
Eat.

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:26.720

Master.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.600
I ran into someone today,

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:33.570
the guy who asked you
to write a letter last time.

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:36.240

I'll find out the truth behind it.

There it is again—that scent.

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:28.370
Here, let me fill your cup.

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:29.440
Not enough.

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:30.320
More!

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:31.720
That's enough.

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:32.630
Lord Zhuge Wu,

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:33.510
from now on,

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:35.030
we'll be counting on you.

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:36.510
Sure thing.

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:40.660
Here, have some more food.

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:43.360
Fill up the cups!

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:44.240
Got it.

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:48.000
Miss, you are so pretty and graceful,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.060
like a lotus right out of clear water.

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:51.630
I wonder if I

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:54.280
may have the honor of buying you a drink.

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:56.790
May I ask who you are, sir?

00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:57.990
That doesn't matter.

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:01.790
Are you my master's beloved one?

00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:03.320
Your master's beloved one?

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:06.000
You have the wrong person.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.030
Impossible.

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:09.910
The Celestial Master has drawn
so many portraits of you for me.

00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:11.550
There is no way I would mistake you.

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:12.030
Yunfei.

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:25.440
I have a friend who looks a lot like you.

00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:26.980
Her name is Qingtong.

00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:29.630
Qingtong?

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:32.700
What a beautiful name.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.120
I wonder

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.000
where she is now.

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:40.830
She must have been held up by something.

00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:42.240
But she'll show up soon.

00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:53.000
Young Master Fugui,

00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:55.310
before the truth comes to light,

00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:57.440
I have to pretend I don't know you.

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:58.270
Otherwise,

00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:00.710
you will be dragged into danger.

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:03.910
Then I hope

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.660
that your wish will come true.

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:14.270
Oh, right.

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:15.670
There is one thing

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:16.750
that you may

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:18.910
be interested in.

[Huntian Prison]

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:22.210
You came for this, didn't you?

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.690
This token belongs to Zhuge Wu.

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:26.910
The Zhuges

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:28.930
usually idle their time away.

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:30.440
It just so happens they

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:32.900
bought themselves posts at Huntian Prison.

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.510
How do you know

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:37.560
that I want this token?

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:40.610
It was not hard.

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.010
Then would you give it to me?

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:48.150
You want this token

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:51.080
only because you want
to enter Huntian Prison.

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.120
As it happens,

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:54.340
I am heading there too.

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:16.360
You two…

00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:18.440
know each other?

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:20.480
We do not.

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:22.950
I am her younger brother.

00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:24.200
May I ask who you are?

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:27.840
Qingtong,

00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:30.120
I saw a bracelet on the way here.

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:32.360
I thought it would look beautiful on you.

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:33.080
Try it on.

00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:39.000
I also bought some candied chestnuts.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.400
I will shell them for you.

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:41.850
They smell amazing.

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:43.540
They must taste really sweet.

00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:45.480
Then I will take my leave.

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:48.560
At midnight tonight,

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:50.170

Well?

00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:14.270
I was not mistaken, was I?

00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:15.560
This nose of mine

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:16.920
never gets it wrong.

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:20.600
But

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.920
why were you two
pretending not to know each other?

Tonight at midnight,

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:28.560
I will go with her

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:30.360
to Huntian Prison.

Shut up.

If she pretends not to know you,

the Celestial Master gave me.

Don't you like the bracelet I gave you?

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:06.550
Qingcheng already has many complaints
about Young Master Fugui.

00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:08.829
I'd better not tell him about tonight

00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:11.319
to avoid unnecessary complications.

00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:15.160
It is just that

so much has happened lately,

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:19.540
and my mind is a little unsettled.

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:21.319

I am from the Li family.

This fried pancake is really delicious.

00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:55.590
Do you want a bite?

00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:58.790
No need.

00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:02.880
You are so dull.

you absolutely cannot
come along as part of her dowry.

What did you just say?

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:12.920
Why is your temper so bad?

that while I am outside,

00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:21.530

riding the sword there and back

00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:46.570
will still take two hours.

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:48.810
We should set out quickly.

00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:50.240
So,

00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:53.130

the binding spell and come out.

With how well Wangquan Fugui
knows your sister,

he will see through your plan very soon.

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:30.940
When that happens,

with Wangquan Fugui
and the whole Yiqi Alliance together,

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.000
it will be hard for us to get away.

I cannot leave yet.

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:39.440
Since the Soldier is
caught in this game too,

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:41.680
we might as well
keep him trapped in it as well.

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:43.480
That way, Gulizan will be safer.

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:46.080
But this is not the time for us
to risk our lives.

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:48.960
I know you cannot bear to leave Qingtong.

and help Gulizan.

I do not want any woman.

Fine.

Since I am sharing your body,

00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:19.750
I have no other choice.

00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:21.720
Tell me your plan.

I am here to examine
the body of Master Ximen.

You think you can just walk in
and examine it?

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.140
Where are your papers?

Then this matter

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:09.860
is quite difficult to handle.

00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:20.050
A prestigious family.

You want to solve the Ximen case—

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:23.980
that's some ambition.

00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:32.640
Yes.

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:34.310
This way.

00:22:53.030 --> 00:22:55.590
There are nine sword wounds
on his limbs and meridians.

00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:57.520
The strikes were very controlled.

00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:01.370
They crippled his martial arts
without taking his life.

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:07.270
The truly fatal one

00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:08.850
is this cut on his neck.

00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:10.440
This sword mark

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.160
looks similar
to the others at first glance,

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:14.920
but the killer struck without hesitation,

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:16.250
killing him instantly.

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:25.830
Qingtong,

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:28.890
I never thought I'd run into you here.

00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:30.830
I was surprised too, Young Master Fugui.

00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:32.030
What are you doing here?

00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:33.560
I came here just to find you.

00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:35.590
Ever since I lost you,

00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:38.040
every day has felt like a lifetime.

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:39.480
Heaven has finally taken pity on me

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:40.830
and let me find you here.

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:42.610
Young Master Fugui,

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:44.890
since I left you,

00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:47.270
I've suffered every single day too.

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:49.440
It's been so long.

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:51.250
You've lost so much weight.

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:53.130
But you haven't changed at all.

00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:55.280
Still as beautiful as ever.

00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:56.350
The truth is,

00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:58.590
I've missed you all this time.

00:23:58.590 --> 00:23:59.580
If you missed me,

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.510
why did you pretend not to know me?

00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:03.070
I have my reasons.

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:05.530
Young Master Fugui,

00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:07.160
could you hold me?

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:09.350
Of course.

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:10.880
If you want to cry,

00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:12.640
lean on my shoulder and cry.

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:13.810
Young Master Fugui,

00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:15.810
I will never leave you again.

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:17.280
Qingtong!

00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:18.960
Qingtong!

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:23.550
Poor Dog?

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:45.790
Stop calling her.

00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:47.250
Miss Qingtong is not here.

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:48.840
Master and Miss Qingtong

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:50.960
went out to drink under the moon.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.200
It's you.

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:55.840
You have a death wish or what?

00:24:56.030 --> 00:24:57.480
Why would I?

00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:01.430
I've got a wife, a master,

00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:03.350
and a pile of pastries.

00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:05.720
Why would I want to die?

00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:12.560
The pastries down south are so soft.

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:16.440
Forget it.

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:19.430
Don't be mad.

00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:21.200
Anger hurts the liver.

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:23.440
I'm only keeping you here a bit longer

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:26.240
so Master and Miss Qingtong
can spend more time together.

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:26.900
Be patient.

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:28.790
Be patient.

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:35.310
I'll

00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:36.510
give you a little tip.

00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:37.790
Stop wasting your energy.

00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:40.000
The Wangquan family
has already inspected the body.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:40.800
The suspect is

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.400
that lowly spider demon.

00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:43.720
The wanted notice

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:45.120
will be out in a day or two.

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:47.200
Take care, Mr. Zhuge.

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:48.670
Oh, right.

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:51.000
I'm not Zhuge Wu.

00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:53.030
The token—

00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:54.790
I borrowed it.

00:26:00.790 --> 00:26:01.650
Stop shouting.

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:04.490
The money I gave you just now

00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:05.790
is enough to treat your wounds.

00:26:05.790 --> 00:26:06.920
What are you waiting for?

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:07.550
Get him!

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:16.540
The sword marks

00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:18.360
are not hard to imitate.

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:21.090
The fatal slash on Master Ximen's neck

00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:23.160
was deliberately staged.

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:27.300
Please contact
Wangquan Manor's Feng Tingyun.

00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:29.080
Have her examine it carefully.

00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:36.790
What did you find?

00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:42.110
The wounds were caused by a sword

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:44.080
called Dust-Seeker.

00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:47.350
But I want to know—

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:51.220
why the attacker hated him so deeply.

00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:55.870
There's some history behind it.

00:26:57.070 --> 00:26:58.240
But the real reason

00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:01.550
is that they hunted demons cruelly,

00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:03.880
taking their cores

00:27:04.550 --> 00:27:06.150
to absorb their demon power.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.200
Then those nine strikes were deserved.

00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:13.480
As for my old friend,

00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:16.480
whatever kind of demon
she wants to become,

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:18.010
whatever path she chooses,

00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:20.170
it doesn't matter.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.030
But she shouldn't

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:25.930
have been framed like this.

00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:32.960
Have you...

00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:39.270
never doubted her?

00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:42.030
Never.

00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:51.160
Young Master Fugui,

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:56.720
I went to Sandstorm Town to find you.

00:27:57.270 --> 00:27:59.000
But I didn't expect your internal injury

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.200
to be so bad.

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:05.900
I didn't want you
to carry all that burden again.

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:10.030
So I…

00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:18.160
Qingtong,

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:20.960
I'm not afraid of carrying burdens.

00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:22.160
I only fear

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:24.880
that something might happen to you.

00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:27.880
The one who framed you knows you so well.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.200
They could even mimic your sword marks.

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:32.790
I believe

00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:36.960
deep down, you know that very well.

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:56.480
Y-You…

00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:57.400
what's wrong?

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:00.730
Have you

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:03.370
just learned how to use talismans?

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:04.270
Yeah,

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:05.640
how did you know?

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:08.840
Isn't this formation
only meant to trap me?

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:11.590
Why does my inner energy feel blocked?

00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:13.190
It's really uncomfortable.

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:14.200
Then…

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:17.880
then what…

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:19.720
should I do now?

00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:22.790
Maybe…

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:25.350
you can free me for a bit?

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:27.310
Fine.

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:43.220
What are you doing?

00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:46.240
Forcing out so much sweat
with demon power

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:48.050
must be exhausting.

00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:51.440
My formation is perfect.

00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:53.350
You think I'm that easy to fool?

00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:58.210
Guess you really
don't understand me at all.

00:29:58.310 --> 00:30:00.480
I eat well and sleep well,

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:01.770
simple but not stupid.

00:30:02.030 --> 00:30:05.690
I'm the prince of Corsac Fox State
who sees his every mission done!

00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:07.070
Wow!

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:09.510
I'm perfect.

00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:10.590
Plus,

00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:13.080
I am the only one among all of us

00:30:13.270 --> 00:30:14.800
who has a wife!

00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:27.450
Don't… don't get angry.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.060
Breaking free by force will hurt you.

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:37.410
You dead dog!

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:38.440
Stop running!

00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:39.270
Hey!

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:41.240
Why are you getting so agitated?

00:30:41.270 --> 00:30:42.720
If you have the guts, don't run!

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:43.750
I already told you,

00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:44.830
my wife doesn't let me fight.

00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:46.430
Where is my sister, exactly?

00:30:47.270 --> 00:30:49.200
I told you
they went to drink under the moon!

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:50.000
Stop right there!

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.120
Make it clear!

00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:06.280
You're serious?

00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:07.310
You can't beat me.

00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:08.790
Then keep going!

00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:44.350
Stop!

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:47.440
I...

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:49.620
Qingcheng.

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:52.460
-What are you doing?
-Qingtong, help me!

00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:55.680
Come with me, all of you.

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:01.030
Let's go.

00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:04.000
You fool.

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:07.260
Miss Qingtong,

00:32:07.510 --> 00:32:09.550
your brother is really good
at playing the victim!

00:32:09.550 --> 00:32:11.150
He wasn't like this just now.

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:12.880
He smashed the inn window.

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:18.570
I told you, didn't I?

00:32:18.790 --> 00:32:20.920
If you break things in someone's shop,

00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:22.250
you have to pay for them.

00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:25.160
You actually have dragon power inside you.

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:26.890
I told you you couldn't beat me.

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:27.520
Qingtong,

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:29.310
this guy just set a trap

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:30.600
and nearly killed me.

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:32.970
You're quite the actor.

00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:34.480
Master, Miss Qingtong,

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:35.720
he's playing the victim.

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:37.320
He wasn't like this just now.

00:32:37.790 --> 00:32:38.270
Enough.

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:40.860
I have made myself very clear.

00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:42.890
Master Ximen was killed by you.

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:44.800
The evidence is conclusive.

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:45.940
Do you really think

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.480
you can keep it a secret?

00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:05.370
Master, what's wrong with you?

00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:07.030
How is it that after one trip out,

00:33:07.030 --> 00:33:09.030
you two look like enemies now?

00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:13.760
But don't worry.

00:33:14.030 --> 00:33:17.400
I prepared two love poems for Xueyang.

00:33:17.790 --> 00:33:18.680
I can

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:20.680
grudgingly let you use them.

00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:22.310
That is unnecessary.

00:33:22.510 --> 00:33:23.310
Don't be shy.

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:28.530
Are you feeling unwell?

00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:31.470
Yunfei, listen to me.

00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:33.310
I have a task

00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:34.880
that I need you to do.

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:48.270
Qingtong, you've been gone for so long.

00:33:48.270 --> 00:33:49.330
You must be hungry.

00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:51.030
I made some desserts.

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:52.680
Please have some.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.310
Has Wangquan Fugui

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:04.970
upset you again, Qingtong?

00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:07.410
You've given him your whole heart.

00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:09.920
After what happened to the Ximen family,

00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:11.400
the first thing you thought about was

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:13.130
not letting him know who you are

00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:15.159
so he wouldn't get dragged into it.

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:19.530
How did you know he was Wangquan Fugui?

00:34:22.630 --> 00:34:24.429
You met him long ago, didn't you?

00:34:25.150 --> 00:34:25.670
I…

00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:26.460
Qingcheng.

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:33.150
What else have you been hiding from me?

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:35.800
No.

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:36.960
Nothing.

00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:43.830
I went with him to Huntian Prison

00:34:44.590 --> 00:34:46.670
to examine the body of Master Ximen.

00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:51.510
The fatal wound on his neck

00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:55.199
is identical to the mark
caused by my Dust-Seeker Sword.

00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:56.920
Whoever's trying to frame me

00:34:58.440 --> 00:34:59.670
is truly vicious.

00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:05.150
The evidence is solid.

00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:08.230
He said he'd go with me

00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:10.980
to Wangquan Manor to clear things up.

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:14.070
He's forcing you to turn yourself in

00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:15.590
so he can wash his hands of it.

00:35:15.590 --> 00:35:16.320
You can't go, Qingtong.

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:17.230
I'll go.

00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:17.880
Qingtong,

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:19.190
why?

00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:22.510
If I go, at least I can prove

00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:25.150
that the Frost's Descent prophecy

00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:26.550
has nothing to do with me.

00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:31.890
Qingcheng.

00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:35.630
I'm going right now.

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:38.300
If anything happens to me,

00:35:40.590 --> 00:35:42.590
you must take good care of yourself…

00:35:45.550 --> 00:35:46.960
and Qianji City.

00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:27.840
Qingtong,

00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:31.590
you can't go to Wangquan Manor.

00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:35.320
You have to listen to me

00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:39.840
and kill Wangquan Shouren.

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:12.920
A puppet talisman…

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:14.760
Qingcheng,

00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:18.690
what did you just say to me?

00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:22.920
You asked me to listen to you

00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:25.230
and kill Wangquan Shouren.

00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:26.280
Qingtong,

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:27.590
please, let me explain.

00:37:27.590 --> 00:37:28.920
What's left to explain?

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:33.600
Looks like Young Master Fugui
was right after all.

00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:35.880
The one behind all this

00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:39.550
really is you.

00:37:41.110 --> 00:37:41.880
Qingtong,

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:43.280
what did he say?

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:44.920
Don't believe him!

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:47.200
Don't tell me…

00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:50.030
everything you just said

00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:52.040
was just to provoke me

00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:53.880
to take action?

00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:55.760
Miss Qingtong, are you alright?

00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:58.020
Call me if you need me. I'm right outside.

00:37:59.110 --> 00:37:59.920
Qingtong,

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:02.560
you worked with those people

00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:04.510
to trick me!

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.400
Tell me yourself.

00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:08.400
Was it you who killed

00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:11.160
the entire Ximen family?

00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:24.840
Yunfei, go after him!

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:25.960
Yes, I'm on it.

00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:26.960
He won't get away!

00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:27.830
Stop running!

00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:31.510
Stop!

00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:32.510
You can't escape!

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:56.460
Qingcheng,

00:38:57.320 --> 00:38:58.850
if I kill Wangquan Shouren,

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:01.900
I'll become a criminal
of the Yiqi Alliance.

00:39:02.590 --> 00:39:03.590
Isn't that right?

00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:07.110
This plan was perfect,

00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:09.840
but his appearance

00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:11.190
ruined everything.

00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:14.000
I'm your only family.

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:17.320
Yet you chose to deceive me with him.

00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:18.690
Be careful.

00:39:19.150 --> 00:39:20.410
He's not your brother.

00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:21.850
Who are you?

00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:24.230
You're not my brother at all!

00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:26.230
If I'm not Qingcheng,

00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:29.800
where is

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:33.360
the real Qingcheng?

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:47.020
Wangquan Shouren's mansion.

00:39:48.110 --> 00:39:48.630
Yunfei.

00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:50.600
Go find Feng Tingyun.

00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:52.000
Tell her to come at once.

00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:52.440
Got it.

00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:11.040
[Wangquan Shouren's mansion]

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:35.860
Let's split up.

00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:37.070
Okay.
