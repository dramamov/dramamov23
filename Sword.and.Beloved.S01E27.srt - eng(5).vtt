[Sword and Beloved]

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.640
[Episode 27]

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.090
Let's split up and search.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.750
Okay.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:38.630
Little Spider...

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.240
All of this...

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.560
All of this is my fault.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.410
I shouldn't have...

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.280
I shouldn't have incited
the Yiqi Alliance...

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:50.710
to punish you.

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.110
I shouldn't have spread rumors,

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.310
called you

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.280
a scourge,

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.310
or said you were despicable.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.910
I'm worse than a beast.

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:07.590
I...

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.750
I...

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.590
I deserve to die.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.080
It's all my fault.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.470
It's my fault...

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:16.870
It's my fault...

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.030
It's my fault...

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:21.310
I...

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:22.520
It's...

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:26.090
Qingcheng!

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.310
Stop it now!

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.630
This damned old bastard...

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.680
he finally got what he deserved.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.130
Though his apology wasn't sincere...

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.360
the way he died was beautiful.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:54.910
Unfortunately,

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.190
my sister and I will never forgive you.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.120
Qingcheng.

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.770
Everything you did before

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.310
was just to drive a wedge between me
and Young Master Fugui.

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:06.710
But now you're exposed.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.260
Why did you still kill him?

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.590
Why?

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.750
Because they hurt you, Sister.

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.680
Those who hurt you must die!

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:22.830
Qingtong,

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.240
don't you understand?

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.040
In this world, the only person
who cares about you

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.190
is me!

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.490
That's not true.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.070
Qingcheng,

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.920
you've been possessed by the Black Fox.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.920
That's why you've become like this.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.800
What?

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.140
Is this the first time you've met this version of me?

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:46.700
Without

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:48.470
the Black Fox's help,

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:50.480
how could I have survived

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.040
that pervert's clutches in Qianji City?

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.920
Qingcheng...

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:00.680
Listen to me.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.270
The Black Fox's power

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.040
will only drag you deeper and deeper.

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.480
You should expel it as soon as possible.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.750
Expel it?

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.680
And go back to being
that lowly little spider?

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:14.610
The spider that could
only crouch in the corner,

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.920
praying for you to look my way?

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.000
No.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.680
I'd rather die.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.360
This is a silence talisman.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.070
Qingcheng.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.080
Don't make a sound later.

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:31.600
Just listen.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.130
What are you going to do?

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.950
Qingcheng?

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:36.040
Either way...

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:38.870
I've lost you.

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:40.800
Today...

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.310
you must choose between us!

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.920
Qingcheng...

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:48.430
Qingcheng...

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:29.630
Wangquan Fugui!

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:46.070
Wangquan Fugui,

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.610
you don't deserve to be with Qingtong.

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:49.920
Today,

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:51.560
either you die

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:53.310
or I do!

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:00.440
Young Master Fugui.

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:10.560
Qingcheng,

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:11.690
let me out.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:19.360
Black Fox,

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:21.070
come out!

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.360
It hurts! It hurts so much!

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:29.250
Sister!

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:30.430
Help me, Sister!

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:31.920
Young Master Fugui,

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:32.800
stop.

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:38.950
I'll say it one more time:

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:39.630
Black Fox,

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:40.620
get the hell out!

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:46.190
Sister,

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:47.800
are you going to leave me

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:48.630
and give up on me?

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:49.510
Sister!

00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.600
Never!

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:21.920
Right now, the priority is

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.070
to figure out

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.430
how to expel the Black Fox
from Qingcheng's body.

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:26.750
Wangquan Fugui,

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.960
it was I who knocked Qingtong out

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:30.480
and took her away.

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.750
It was I

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:34.409
who tried every way
to stop her from finding you.

00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:37.080
It was I who told her you were dead

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.360
to make her let go of you.

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:42.240
I did all of that!

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:56.030
Wangquan Fugui,

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:57.240
that's it.

00:08:57.790 --> 00:08:58.960
Hit me.

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.270
The crueler, the better.

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:15.710
If Qingcheng keeps provoking
Young Master Fugui,

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:17.720
he'll die along with the Black Fox.

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:23.510
The one who deserves to die
is the Black Fox.

00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:25.120
I can't abandon Qingcheng.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:30.620
Qingcheng,

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:32.910
you've colluded with the Black Fox,

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:34.510
striking cruelly at humans.

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:37.440
You even dragged Qingtong
into your schemes.

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:38.680
Come back with me now

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.980
and confess everything about you
and the Black Fox.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:49.730
Young Master Fugui.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.240
Qingcheng was simply bewitched
by the Black Fox.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:53.510
Please spare his life!

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:56.080
Qingtong.

00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:58.750
I never intended to kill him.

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:01.480
I only wanted to expel
the Black Fox from his body.

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:03.920
But if you do that...

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:06.120
Qingcheng will die too.

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:08.600
In order to expel the Black Fox,

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:11.200
he'd even sacrifice himself.

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:13.270
Do you think he'd spare me?

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:14.000
Shut up!

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:16.510
All disciples of the alliance, listen up!

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:17.320
Search this place thoroughly,

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:18.670
inside and out!

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:20.360
If you find any suspicious demons,

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.080
bring them back to
Wangquan Manor immediately!

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:22.960
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:23.550
Sister,

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:26.080
the Yiqi Alliance won't let me off.

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.030
Save me!

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:30.150
You're still talking nonsense.

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:30.720
Sister,

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:32.600
he'll kill me.

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:35.440
I'll handle the Black Fox

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:37.580
inside Qingcheng's body.

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:44.700
Why is there also a trace of power

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:48.330
similar to the Black Fox
within Qingtong's demon power?

00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:55.150
Junior,

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:58.370
this time I broke the binding spell

00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:00.080
and left the Western Regions,

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:02.210
violating the Yiqi Alliance's rules.

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:05.270
Senior Fugui, you did nothing wrong.

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:06.800
Why should you be expelled?

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:08.440
I can't beat you anyway.

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:11.700
In the future, wherever you want to go...

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.050
I also won't be able to stop you.

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:27.670
How is the Chief?

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:33.670
The Master...

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:36.550
is doing well.

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:43.550
I left you a letter...

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:46.260
in Huntian Prison.

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:50.150
I've already confirmed it myself.

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:51.550
Actually, I also believe

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:52.970
that Little Spider

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:54.360
would never commit

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.020
such heartless, insane acts.

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:57.440
If she didn't do it,

00:11:58.390 --> 00:11:59.990
we won't falsely accuse her.

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:02.250
Actually, it was a little black fox

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:06.090
that possessed her brother
and did these things.

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:07.200
The alliance

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.130
will definitely not

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:10.720
let this matter rest easily.

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:13.150
If Qianji City doesn't
hand over Qingcheng,

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:14.480
the alliance will never

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:16.510
let the matter rest.

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:19.240
Will the alliance

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.080
besiege the city?

00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:22.550
Yes.

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:28.870
Junior.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.240
Can you give me some time?

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:38.440
Okay.

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:50.870
Finally...

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:54.150
Finally, for once...

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:58.080
you chose me.

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:11.010
There's no time.

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.630
I need to expel the Black Fox
from his body now.

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:15.890
Otherwise, Qingcheng will be in danger.

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:30.720
Why can't my Power of Love
connect with Qingcheng's?

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:33.050
The power inside his body is resisting me.

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:39.500
Qingcheng,

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:41.570
you need to trust me.

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:43.080
I need you to

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:45.850
defeat the Black Fox together with me.

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:52.630
Sister, if you give the antidote
to the Soldier,

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:53.840
what about you?

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.670
You promised me

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:57.510
you'd stay with me.

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:01.290
Qingcheng, listen to me.

00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:02.550
Go to Deer Village now.

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:03.460
It's safe there.

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:04.870
Hurry up. Go!

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:07.630
I won't leave without you!

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:17.480
What a twist of fate.

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:21.480
The Black Fox actually exploited
this opportunity.

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:22.750
Qingcheng,

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:24.440
I believe in you.

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.960
You have to believe in yourself too.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.930
You must break free
from the control of the Black Fox!

00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:37.910
Why...

00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:41.720
Why do you still
refuse to connect with me?

00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:43.950
Why did you cut off my Power of Love?

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:46.090
How am I supposed to save you like this?

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:11.650
So it was you
who instigated that spider demon

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.440
to awaken me?

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:17.200
I'm Quan Jingting.

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:19.550
Greetings, Queen of Qianxia.

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:21.320
What is it

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:23.870
that you truly want?

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:27.200
Back then, Your Majesty stepped forward

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:29.870
and ultimately sacrificed everyone
in your Qianxia Kingdom

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:32.030
through the Myriad Blight Formation

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:35.200
to slay the Berserk Dragon.

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:38.910
But 1,000 years have passed.

00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:40.950
Your Majesty, do you know

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:42.910
which demon clan now reigns over

00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:45.390
the Western Regions?

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:51.120
It's the one you hate most—

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:53.240
the cunning and treacherous
Corsac Fox Clan,

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:55.600
which left your kingdom
standing alone and helpless,

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.630
ultimately forcing you to

00:15:57.960 --> 00:15:59.550
sacrifice your people.

00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:03.910
A thousand years have passed.

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:08.240
Who still remembers
your kingdom's sacrifice?

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:12.030
The peace you bought with your blood

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:15.000
is now being enjoyed by those traitors.

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:16.440
Enough.

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:19.370
I'm already aware of what you said.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.330
Now that I've awakened,

00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:22.960
I naturally won't spare

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:25.370
the Corsac Fox Clan or the Dragon Clan.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.360
But I don't understand.

00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:29.790
Madam Black Fox asked that little spider

00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:31.960
to help me escape and get revenge.

00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:34.910
What exactly do you want from me?

00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:36.550
And what can you

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:38.360
offer me in return?

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:46.440
Back then,

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:49.080
though the Myriad Blight Formation
you set up

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:50.840
wasn't large in scale,

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:54.500
it could help you obtain supreme power
to kill the Berserk Dragon.

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:55.790
What if Your Majesty

00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:58.750
set up the Myriad Blight Formation
across the entire Western Regions

00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:01.790
and sacrificed all beings in the region?

00:17:05.109 --> 00:17:06.480
The power obtained

00:17:07.349 --> 00:17:09.240
could slay 100 berserk dragons.

00:17:09.349 --> 00:17:09.880
No!

00:17:11.109 --> 00:17:12.550
The power obtained

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:14.640
would be born of tremendous hatred.

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:18.400
It could help Madam Black Fox
take physical form overnight.

00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:21.880
From then on, love will fade
and hatred will rise in this world.

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:23.880
The Black Fox destroying the world—

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:28.000
would that appease

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:31.360
Your Majesty's lingering grievances?

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:32.590
Sounds good.

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:36.720
But to unseal the Myriad Blight Formation

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:38.880
requires the combined power of three clans

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:40.110
to activate it.

00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:41.590
I wonder,

00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:43.650
do any dragon demons still exist now?

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:17.880
Jin,

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:19.570
stop playing. Time to eat.

00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:22.030
Today we have your favorite daylilies.

00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:24.200
Jin?

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:26.880
Jin?

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:33.240
Master!

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:34.400
Master!

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:35.080
Master...

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:36.680
Master.

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:38.760
Can't you be a bit more composed?

00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:39.310
Master,

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:40.680
the scouts report

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:42.640
that something is wrong
with the Dragon Clan.

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:43.480
Go on.

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:44.520
Recently,

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:47.730
many little dragon demons
have gone missing.

00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:48.830
Their chief

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:51.110
has led many clansmen to the Saintess,

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:53.170
demanding that she deliver justice.

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:57.610
The Saintess of the Dragon Clan
will uncover the truth.

00:18:57.790 --> 00:18:58.550
However,

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:02.020
most of the descendants
of the Dragon Clan are hybrids.

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:03.530
Their demon power is weak.

00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:05.550
Then why abduct them?

00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:09.550
Saintess of the Dragon Clan...

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:10.960
Could their target be...

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:12.200
Weiyun?

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:13.170
This is bad.

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:16.110
Come with me.

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:31.920
Let those kids go!

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:48.680
Don't be afraid.

00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:49.630
It's alright.

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:56.880
Who exactly are you?

00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:01.930
You don't need to know who I am.

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:04.030
I came to you today

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:05.960
for your dragon power.

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:23.200
You abducted those kids as bait

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:25.240
just to lure me out.

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:27.400
You're clever,

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:29.520
but you realized it too late.

00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:31.450
A thousand years have passed.

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:33.960
The Western Regions have changed a lot.

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:36.000
Your Dragon Clan

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:38.940
still has you left—the last pure-blood.

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:40.830
Fine.

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:42.930
You're all going to die anyway.

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:02.860
What's your real purpose?

00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:06.550
This is the Dream Formation
I specially prepared for you.

00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:07.990
Using dreams as a prison,

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:09.920
it can make you willingly

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:11.920
offer your True Dragon Power.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.550
Be good and give me

00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:14.720
your power.

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:23.640
Weiyun!

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:26.640
Weiyun!

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:34.330
Master, I'll go check.

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:52.830
Nothing.

00:21:56.550 --> 00:21:57.590
I'm afraid...

00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:01.120
something's already happened to Weiyun.

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:05.610
What's this?

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:07.080
A tracking talisman.

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:08.200
Go.

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:19.750
Weiyun!

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:21.260
Those children...

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:24.750
Master.

00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:26.560
What's this?

00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:29.000
Bound by dreams,

00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:33.250
one's life force drains away
until they perish with the dream.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.350
This is a Dream Formation!

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:36.350
Dream Formation?

00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:38.160
Such an ancient formation—

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:40.110
wasn't it supposed to
have been lost long ago?

00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:41.310
Dragon demons are proud and willful.

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:42.880
To absorb Weiyun's dragon power,

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:44.080
you need her consent.

00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:45.830
But within this Dream Formation,

00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:47.690
her consciousness won't resist.

00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:48.400
Right now,

00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:50.590
Weiyun is

00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:51.880
trapped in a dream.

00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:54.990
When her dragon power is fully drained,

00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:57.640
that will be the moment
she awakens—and dies.

00:22:58.030 --> 00:22:59.230
What should we do now?

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:02.110
The only way now

00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:04.290
is for me to enter the dream

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:05.640
and wake her up.

00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:06.640
Master.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.030
If you fail to return,

00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:09.000
you'll just be throwing your life away.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:09.790
Let's think of another way!

00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:10.990
There's no other way!

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:14.590
I'll enter the formation first

00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:15.550
to save Weiyun.

00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:18.000
As for those young demons,

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:18.750
once I enter the formation,

00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:20.750
I'll break a section of the barrier.

00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:21.830
You must

00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:23.710
take them away immediately.

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:27.440
How utterly foolish—

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.400
you actually dared to enter the formation.

00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:32.920
Since you have a death wish,

00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:35.410
stay trapped in the dream forever

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:37.110
with your Weiyun.

00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:03.170
[Wedding]

00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:07.860
[Dream Formation; Long Weiyun's Dream]

00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:17.310
Ruhua.

00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:17.790
My Lady.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:18.830
Do you think

00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:21.240
this hairpin goes well

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:22.570
with that lip rouge?

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:23.680
My Lady,

00:24:23.790 --> 00:24:25.310
you really shouldn't worry so much.

00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:27.200
You and your future husband

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:28.160
are childhood sweethearts

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:29.440
with deep feelings for each other.

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:31.400
You're a match made in heaven.

00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:34.310
I think so too.

00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:36.570
We're a perfect match.

00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:28.480
Who are you?

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:34.720
You are...

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:37.850
a defiler who preys on innocent girls!

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:40.000
Guards...

00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:50.440
Breaking into a maiden's chamber

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:51.900
in the middle of the night—

00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:54.680
he really is a defiler.

00:25:56.790 --> 00:25:58.320
I can lift the spell for you,

00:25:58.440 --> 00:25:59.640
but on one condition:

00:25:59.830 --> 00:26:01.400
no shouting or screaming.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.260
You can take my wealth,

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:11.570
but not my chastity!

00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:13.350
Weiyun,

00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:15.200
think carefully.

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:17.590
You really don't remember me?

00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:18.880
You're just a defiler.

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:20.510
Why should I know you?

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:24.830
I'm

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:26.350
not a defiler.

00:26:27.270 --> 00:26:29.400
And you're not the young lady
of the Long family.

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:30.720
I can let you go.

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:32.310
But first,

00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:34.030
tell me

00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:35.550
about your husband.

00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:36.880
What's wrong with you?

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:39.720
Why should I tell you about my fiancé?

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:41.780
There's something wrong with me.

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:44.680
And when my madness strikes,
I drink blood and devour raw flesh.

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:45.810
I especially love to

00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:48.430
ruin the faces of beautiful girls.

00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:50.070
You...

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:51.790
Don't...

00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:53.030
Don't go mad!

00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:54.110
Well,

00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:56.840
that depends on how you behave.

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:01.110
My fiancé and I are

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:03.120
childhood sweethearts.

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:06.510
His nickname is Sigou.

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:08.160
He was frail as a child

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:09.620
and suffered from asthma.

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:12.240
When he was 12,

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:14.340
he met a soft-hearted great demon

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:16.590
who cured his illness.

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:18.750
Actually...

00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:21.510
I didn't even like him at first.

00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:24.510
But he was thick-skinned.

00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:29.200
He kept following me,

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:30.480
calling me "Sister."

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:32.370
I couldn't even drive him away.

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:35.090
And because he was thick-skinned,

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:36.750
you fell for him?

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:37.920
Of course not.

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:41.400
Once, I encountered danger outside

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.660
and nearly became demonized.

00:27:44.790 --> 00:27:46.480
He risked his life to save me

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:49.370
and carried me all the way back.

00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:53.210
Although I was barely conscious
in his arms,

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:55.400
I still had a bit of awareness.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.680
I could hear his heartbeat.

00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:01.200
I knew that...

00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:04.550
he truly liked me—

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:06.640
so much that I was

00:28:08.030 --> 00:28:10.230
more important to him than his own life.

00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:13.880
So...

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:16.720
you're going to marry him?

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:17.350
Of course.

00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:19.830
Once I marry him,

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:21.830
we'll live a simple,

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:24.400
happy life together.

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:27.790
Weiyun,

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:30.960
is this really the perfect dream

00:28:31.790 --> 00:28:33.270
in your mind?

00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:36.550
So I've been

00:28:37.510 --> 00:28:38.840
in your heart all along.

00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:43.720
Why are you looking at me like that?

00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:46.270
I-I'm telling you,

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:50.240
I'd rather die than betray my husband.

00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:54.480
So...

00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:56.870
can you still remember

00:28:57.310 --> 00:28:58.970
what your husband looks like?

00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:09.000
His...

00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:11.350
His looks...

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:26.960
Why is it him?

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:31.930
My daughter,

00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:34.440
you wouldn't come to eat when called.

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:35.500
You must be hungry.

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:37.720
We've brought you something to eat.

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:43.030
Father, Mother.

00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:46.650
I think I'm haunted by an evil spirit.

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:49.680
I had such a ridiculous dream.

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:53.480
Yun,

00:29:53.790 --> 00:29:54.590
it's alright.

00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:57.240
I've brought back many safety talismans.

00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:59.310
We'll paste them all over your room.

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:00.640
Outside,

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:03.030
I've assigned extra guards
to patrol in shifts.

00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:03.880
Don't worry.

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:05.280
Everything will be fine.

00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:08.510
"All gods above,

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:10.700
there's a night wanderer in my home."

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:16.270
I-I got the wrong one.

00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:18.400
You...

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:21.180
At such a crucial moment,
you pull this on me.

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:22.790
Our daughter is getting married
in two days.

00:30:22.790 --> 00:30:23.350
You...

00:30:23.550 --> 00:30:25.030
Why are you so unreliable?

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:26.790
Mother.

00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:28.480
I'm hungry.

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:30.800
I want some sweet fruit soup.

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:31.880
Alright, alright.

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:33.200
I'll get it for you right away.

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:33.590
Yes.

00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:49.200
Who is he?

00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:18.160
Weiyun.

00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:20.040
I know that...

00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:22.310
in this dream,

00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:24.120
you're living a happy life.

00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:25.830
But a dream is a dream.

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:29.400
I'll give you real happiness.

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:39.240
Heaven and earth,

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:43.000
please let my wedding with my beloved

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:46.310
go smoothly today.

00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:11.210
What happened?

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:18.510
Why is everyone frozen?

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:21.000
Ruhua.

00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:22.110
Ruhua?

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:25.000
What's happening?

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:26.890
Weiyun.

00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:30.530
I've come to take you away.

00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:41.270
Who are you?

00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:43.560
Undo your evil spell right now.

00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:44.610
I'm warning you,

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.720
don't delay my important business.

00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:48.450
Do you know where you are going?

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:50.440
Can't you tell?

00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:53.170
I'm getting married today.

00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:55.550
I'm going to meet my fiancé.

00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:56.640
Where is he?

00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:00.160
Shouldn't I be

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:02.440
your fiancé?

00:33:15.790 --> 00:33:17.070
What's going on?

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:18.590
This man

00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:20.590
looks exactly like my fiancé.

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:23.550
That person

00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:26.080
was supposed to be me all along.

00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:27.440
You...

00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:30.550
How can you hear what I'm thinking?

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:31.590
Because

00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:34.840
I'm the one you've been thinking about...

00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:37.310
Quan Rumu.

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:39.410
You must have used some evil magic.

00:33:39.550 --> 00:33:40.070
Fine.

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:41.920
Let me ask you something.

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:43.790
You said you and your fiancé
were childhood sweethearts,

00:33:43.790 --> 00:33:45.030
innocent companions.

00:33:45.030 --> 00:33:45.880
Then why

00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:47.670
can't you remember his face?

00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:50.700
Here's another question:

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:52.240
you just said

00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:54.070
I look exactly like him.

00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:55.750
So why, when you first saw me,

00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:57.150
didn't you recognize me?

00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:58.030
You even said

00:33:58.400 --> 00:33:59.550
I was a defiler.

00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:01.030
Don't you think

00:34:01.030 --> 00:34:03.160
something feels off about your world?

00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:05.410
Because right now,

00:34:06.270 --> 00:34:07.510
you're in your dream.

00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:20.150
Every word I've said is true.

00:34:21.070 --> 00:34:21.960
I swear it.

00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:32.219
Be careful what you swear,
or the heavens will strike you down!

00:34:33.590 --> 00:34:34.190
Oh, right.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:36.320
What is that place?

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:38.360
The Thunder Pool.

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:41.480
You don't know?

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:45.150
The Thunder Pool is always
full of lightning and thunder,

00:34:45.150 --> 00:34:46.810
with winds as sharp as blades.

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:49.610
Some say it's where demons
undergo tribulation,

00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:52.270
while others say
it's where immortals ascend.

00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:54.880
In any case, it's not a place
for us mortals.

00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:57.360
My parents always warned me

00:34:57.630 --> 00:34:59.160
that the place is dangerous

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:01.200
and that we should stay far away.

00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:05.010
Stay far from the Thunder Pool...

00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:07.030
In her subconscious,

00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:10.030
her parents warned her to stay away
from the Thunder Pool.

00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:11.590
Could that mean the Thunder Pool

00:35:11.590 --> 00:35:14.050
is the weakest point
in the Dream Formation?

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:14.890
Let's go.

00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:17.230
We're going to the Thunder Pool.

00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:18.320
Are you crazy?

00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:19.840
Have you lost your mind?

00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:21.000
If you want to die,

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:21.880
go alone.

00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:23.010
Don't drag me along.

00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:46.110
Let go of me.

00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:51.280
If I let go,

00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:53.110
you'll be in danger.

00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:56.490
You are Long Weiyun,

00:35:57.230 --> 00:35:58.400
the one I love.

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:00.230
You've been harmed by someone

00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:01.490
and trapped in a dream.

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:03.150
This dream is

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:05.100
absorbing your dragon power.

00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:06.590
And in reality,

00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:07.960
you're slowly dying.

00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:10.770
The longer we stay,
