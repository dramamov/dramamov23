[Sword and Beloved]

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.460
[Episode 28]

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.479
Qingtong is Wangquan Fugui's
only weakness.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.400
He and those fools from Yiqi Alliance

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.040
will all be trapped in my scheme,

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.080
too busy
to bother with the Western Regions.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.920
This plan may be risky,

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:05.800
but I must say

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.800
it's a brilliant move.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.320
Relax.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.160
I'd already set everything in motion
before I left.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.760
Everything is still under my control.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.680
Master,

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:55.800
the 3 kids from the Dragon Clan

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.329
have been safely sent back.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.160
I'm afraid

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.010
this isn't over yet.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.880
Send people

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.320
to investigate
the Dream Formation immediately

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.280
and find out

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:09.760
who's behind it.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.080
Yes.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.490
Everything about this feels strange.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.930
When Weiyun wakes up, I need to ask her.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.480
For now, the top priority

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.079
is to send word to my brother.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.960
Don't worry, Royal Master.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.490
They can't escape forever.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:42.520
It's okay.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.660
Your tone is quite similar

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.880
to the Celestial Master's.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:53.760
Fugui,

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.960
something's happened
in the Western Regions.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.720
A woman with a golden serpent-bone scepter

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:58.840
who can control minds

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.120
has been capturing people for sacrifice.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.050
Even Long Weiyun was caught by her.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.210
But don't worry.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.900
I've already rescued her.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.900
I'll keep investigating.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.160
I'll let you know immediately

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.360
if I get any new leads.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.360
A serpent-bone scepter?

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:17.880
Mind control?

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.600
I once read the secret histories
of the Western Regions in your house.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.600
They mentioned a scepter like that.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.380
It was said to belong to

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.260
the queen of Qianxia Kingdom.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.520
Qianxia Kingdom?

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.360
Didn't Qianxia Kingdom perish long ago?

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.159
That's right.

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:34.960
A thousand years ago,

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.140
it was indeed destroyed
because of the Dragon Clan.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.940
Why did it suddenly reappear?

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.159
Yunfei,

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.840
go investigate this thoroughly

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:45.760
with Rumu.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.080
If I leave,

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.060
what about you?

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.360
This

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.580
must have something to do
with the Black Fox.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.000
Don't worry.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.120
I can go to Qianji City alone.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.680
Let's stay in touch.

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.800
Sister.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.860
You finally came to see me.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.290
Did you think of a way to save me?

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:29.220
Qingcheng,

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:30.880
I can let you go,

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.010
but you must abandon
the Black Fox inside you.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.280
I need the Black Fox's power

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.930
to keep that Soldier away from you.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:43.680
Even now,

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.780
you still show no remorse.

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.520
Why should I feel remorse for anything?

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.680
Seeing you turn against that Soldier
because of me

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:53.960
made me so happy.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:54.960
Enough nonsense!

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.480
Get out

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.560
of my brother's body.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:14.960
The power of the tree seed

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.960
can actually hurt the Black Fox?

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.560
It hurts.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.260
You have power strong enough
to threaten me?

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.520
But it's useless.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.720
As long as I'm in his body,

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.560
you can't do anything to me

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.400
without hurting him.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.520
Qingcheng needs me.

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.000
He needs my power.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.360
Look at you.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.880
You're full of contradictions.

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.960
Your power shares the same origin as ours,

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.700
yet you don't feed on the Power of Hatred.

00:06:56.159 --> 00:06:58.040
Why don't you side with the Madam?

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.160
She'll help you

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.320
gain the supreme Power of Hatred.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.040
Think about it.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.860
After all, even if you kill your brother,

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.280
you can't do anything to me.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:11.680
Fine.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:14.780
Since that's the case,

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.200
I'll trap you

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.840
in Qianji City forever,

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.180
so you'll never be able to accomplish

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.400
what you want to do.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:28.840
Qingtong!

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:42.840
[Li]

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:43.280
Boss,

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:45.120
this Poor Dog...

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.520
Before they got married,

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:48.760
he came by

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:49.840
every day.

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.000
But ever since he got married,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.480
we haven't even seen him.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.010
Do you think they...

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.280
I'm telling you, they're doing just fine.

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:00.610
Maybe they just went out on some business.

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:01.720
How do you know everything?

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:02.920
What's that question?

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.520
Without me,
they wouldn't even be together.

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:05.600
I'm telling you, Poor Dog

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.400
should be thanking me right now.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:08.520
Thank you.

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:09.570
You're welcome.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:11.420
Poor Dog...

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:13.320
No.

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:14.880
Young Master Yunfei.

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:15.920
You must be tired from the journey.

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:16.560
Let me.

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:17.280
No need.

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.040
This is a gift I brought for Xueyang.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.620
There are some for you too.

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:31.320
Alright.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:40.140
How do you feel?

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.039
Nothing.

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:42.520
What is this?

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.580
It's called a facial mask.

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.560
It's a gift I bought for Xueyang.

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.160
You bought it for General?

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.280
Then why did you apply it on our face?

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:49.920
Yeah.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.020
I've got to test it first, don't I?

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.880
What if my Xueyang

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:55.880
is allergic to it?

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:57.920
That makes sense.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:08:58.720
That makes sense.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.250
We don't need faces anyway.

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:01.960
Don't say that.

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.320
Here, let me put on some more.

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:06.790
More, more.

00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:08.000
Here.

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:11.160
-Here too.
-Here.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:12.220
What are you doing?

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:12.920
General.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:14.600
What is this?

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.120
Boss, I'm Zhao.

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.120
I'm Xiang.

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:21.720
What's that on your faces?

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.000
I'm doing an experiment.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.200
I bought you a facial mask.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.280
It's good for your skin.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:28.120
Very good.

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:28.720
Very good.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.130
I missed you so much.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:33.800
I'm glad you're back.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.120
I missed you so much.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.450
Let me take a look at you.

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:38.840
You've lost weight.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.380
And you got tanned.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:41.040
Young Master.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:41.800
I look better darker.

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:43.200
Young Master? Young Master?

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:43.920
Do you still need us?

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:44.480
I...

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000
What do you think?

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:46.960
Got it.

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:48.000
Let's go.

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:49.560
Xueyang,

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:53.040
I picked all of these especially for you.

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:54.350
What do you think?

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:55.320
Do you like them?

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:56.200
Yes.

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:58.040
Oh, right.

00:09:58.400 --> 00:09:59.480
There's...

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.080
this one.

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:03.920
This lip balm is from Xifang Studio.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:05.240
It's hard to buy.

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:06.880
Smell it.

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:09.090
Smells good.

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:10.520
Let me

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:11.760
put some on you.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:12.520
Okay.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:32.880
Pretty?

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:34.360
Yes.

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:36.200
Beautiful.

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:46.080
How did the mission go this time?

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:47.840
Perfectly.

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.180
I helped the Master find his wife.

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:51.080
Really?

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:51.840
Yes.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:53.560
Amazing, right?

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:55.280
My Poor Dog never lets me down.

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:58.200
Since I did such a great job,

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.130
don't you think I deserve a reward?

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:03.130
What kind of reward do you want?

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.360
I've been talking for so long

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:11.080
that my lips are a little dry.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:38.800
Well...

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:41.810
Since you've found Miss Qingtong,

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.880
why didn't they come back together?

00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:46.120
Master sent me back

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:48.200
to investigate a woman

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:49.880
with a serpent-bone scepter.

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:52.160
A serpent-bone scepter?

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:55.900
Golden, inlaid with a gem?

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:57.370
You've seen her?

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:05.280
I met someone like that a few days ago

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:06.320
during a patrol.

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:09.150
She was very similar to your description,

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:10.480
but I didn't get a clear look

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.520
at her face.

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:14.420
I only saw a golden scepter

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.600
with a gemstone in her hand.

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:19.920
Who is she?

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.280
I've never seen her before.

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:21.840
Boss,

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:23.250
her name's Gulizan.

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:24.200
She's the leader

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:25.360
of a newly founded sect

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:26.880
in the Western Regions.

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:29.040
I heard she's fabulously wealthy,

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.000
and lately she's been spending a fortune

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.530
recruiting disciples
to establish her sect.

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:36.320
Send someone to keep an eye on her.

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:37.980
I want to know her background.

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:38.680
Yes.

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:40.960
So according to you,

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:42.640
the person Master asked me
to keep an eye on

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:43.700
should be Gulizan.

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:45.280
What's going on with her?

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:47.520
I don't know the details.

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:49.080
I only know she's connected

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:51.140
to the recent demon disappearances.

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:52.400
Master

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:55.400
suspects it has something to do
with the Black Fox.

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:56.060
Alright...

00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:58.080
Zhao.

00:12:58.920 --> 00:12:59.440
Yes.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:02.290
General, what is it?

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.280
How's your investigation of the new sect

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:05.940
I asked you to look into going?

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:06.880
I heard

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:07.960
they're recruiting disciples

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:10.040
with very high
spiritual power requirements.

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.600
But with the amount of money
they're offering,

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:13.260
plenty of people joined them.

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:15.480
There's something strange.

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:17.120
The food they buy

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:18.480
and the fertilizer they produce every day

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:19.600
haven't increased at all.

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:20.730
Haven't increased?

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:21.320
Yes.

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:22.560
Go to the Quan family

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:24.020
and invite Quan Rumu over.

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:24.640
Yes.

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:25.800
No need.

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:28.280
He's already here.

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:29.340
Celestial Master?

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:31.050
Long time no see!

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:32.220
Celestial Master!

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:33.540
Did you miss me?

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:35.620
Alright, alright.

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:37.450
I can't breathe.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:38.920
Not bad.

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:40.320
You not only completed the mission,

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.480
but also found...

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:43.360
-Miss Qingtong.
-Miss Qingtong.

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:45.090
It's all thanks to my training.

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:49.920
Who is this?

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:51.720
This...

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:54.280
This must be Celestial Master's wife,
right?

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:55.560
The one...

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:57.280
you dated for a while?

00:13:58.120 --> 00:13:59.920
Don't go spouting the obvious.

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:01.040
I'm not his wife.

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:05.620
I'm of the Dragon Clan.

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:09.050
The Dragon Clan?

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:11.440
The Dragon Clan
that has a thousand-year feud

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:14.120
with your Corsac Fox Clan and the Li Army.

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:17.000
The Li Army

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:18.720
has a thousand-year blood feud

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:20.320
with the Dragon Clan.

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:22.050
What is your purpose

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:23.920
in coming here today?

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:26.960
The Li Army and the Corsac Fox Clan

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:29.090
also have a thousand-year blood feud.

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:31.440
Have you forgotten, General Li?

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.560
My family affairs

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.640
are none of your concern.

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:40.280
Since you're here today,

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:43.400
I'll make you repay your blood debt
with blood!

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:44.520
Don't!

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:51.640
Celestial Master,

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:52.870
what should we do?

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:53.980
What else can we do?

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.200
Go talk to Xueyang.

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.400
And I'll talk to Weiyun.

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.320
We must not let those two meet again.

00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:59.760
Cut the crap.

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:01.220
-Let's go.
-Wei...

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:04.640
That scent from your sleeve earlier

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:05.840
smelled really nice.

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:06.320
What?

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.800
This is my newly brewed perfume.

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:14.440
Amazing.

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:16.200
Can you teach me to make it?

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:16.840
I'll give you some.

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:18.080
Thank you, Miss Long.

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:20.960
Teach me.

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:21.720
Celestial Master,

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:22.680
did they...

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:24.200
fight just now?

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:25.920
They must...

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:27.080
have,

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:28.920
though somehow it also looked like...

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:29.650
they didn't.

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:33.600
No, no, no.

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:35.080
Wait.

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:39.600
The Dragon Clan and the Li Army

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:41.840
had a deadly feud a thousand years ago.

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:44.120
Aren't you going to get revenge?

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:45.320
Didn't you say?

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:47.330
It was a thousand years ago.

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:50.520
What's the point
of fighting over this now?

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:54.580
Right now, the peace
in the Western Regions is more important.

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:55.120
Yes.

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:01.160
Then you just...

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:02.140
Just...

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:03.010
They just...

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:04.570
greeted each other.

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:05.880
They greeted each other.

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:07.480
It was how girls

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:09.040
greet each other.

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:11.800
So you were greeting each other.

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:12.360
Right?

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:14.600
Since we're here,

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:15.600
shouldn't you...

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:18.560
offer some hospitality?

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:21.600
Xueyang,

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:23.320
eat more.

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:24.450
You've lost weight.

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:26.400
Let me try.

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:28.920
Here, have some more.

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.490
Celestial Master, don't just watch. Eat.

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:45.800
Weiyun.

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:48.280
Have some meat.

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:48.640
Here.

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:50.170
Eat more.

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:53.440
-I'm not hungry. I'll just drink.
-Xueyang, this is good.

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:56.200
Miss Long, drink as much as you like.

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.120
There's plenty.

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:57.760
Thank you.

00:16:58.640 --> 00:16:59.500
Here, Xueyang.

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:00.840
I didn't take anything
from the spicy side.

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:01.920
Only this side.

00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:07.599
It's...

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:09.560
for me?

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:11.140
I don't eat spicy food.

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:12.760
I'll eat it.

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:26.089
Let's get down to business.

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:27.920
What's the deal

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:28.980
with this Gulizan?

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:32.160
We still don't know her background.

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:34.880
But to rise so fast

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:36.010
in such a short time,

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:38.320
her strength must be extraordinary.

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:39.880
We don't know what to do yet.

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:41.320
I heard

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:43.680
she pays a lot to recruit disciples.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.120
Then tomorrow morning,

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:46.560
let's disguise ourselves

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:48.360
and respond to her recruitment.

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:49.080
I know.

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:51.040
It's called "no risk,

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:52.560
no reward."

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:56.280
[Gulizan's Mansion]

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:58.280
Gulizan only accepts people
with strong spiritual power.

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:00.340
We'll have to show our real strength.

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:03.160
Weiyun's dragon power was damaged before,

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:05.080
and she has directly confronted Gulizan.

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:06.210
She can't go with us.

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:08.880
But she has disguised herself
as a kitchen maid

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:10.940
and infiltrated to assist us inside.

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:26.960
My Lady,

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:29.440
these have all passed
the preliminary tests.

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:30.200
What topic

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:31.520
should we give them today

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:33.450
for the next round of competition?

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:35.280
I'm a little tired today.

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:37.520
I'll pick some who catch my eye.

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:38.000
Yes.

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:50.780
This one is too fat.

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:51.840
No.

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:54.180
This one...

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:55.480
has no hair.

00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:56.760
No.

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:02.340
This one is too old.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:03.800
No.

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:06.120
I just look old.

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:07.200
I'm perfectly healthy,

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:08.120
and my hearing is great.

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:11.180
Maybe I'll even grow a little taller
in a couple of days.

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:13.600
I'll go. I'll go.

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:33.780
You can use a spear?

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:35.480
Yes.

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:37.520
It's a family technique.

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:41.300
A woman stronger than any man.

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:42.600
I'm lucky

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:44.480
to have met you.

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:47.210
Alright.

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:48.290
You can stay.

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:51.520
You may leave.

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:54.400
As for these two,

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:56.140
I need more time to decide.

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:09.320
Gentlemen,

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:11.420
let me hear about your strengths.

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:12.800
Wait.

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:14.520
This scene...

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:16.800
why does it feel so familiar?

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:18.530
Beauty,

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:19.920
what's your name?

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:22.400
How about I give you a chance tonight?

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:24.120
Massage here.

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:26.240
Why are you wearing it?

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:29.520
My Lady,

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:31.720
my name is Situ Wuming.

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:33.090
You may not know,

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:34.560
but I have excellent character

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:35.680
and am skilled in swordsmanship.

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:36.600
People call me

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:37.660
the No. 1 swordsman

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:39.250
of the Western Regions.

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:40.760
He's good.

00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:41.560
That's right.

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:43.880
He should be your lucky guy tonight.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:45.640
Yes.

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:48.320
No hurry.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.130
I still want to hear about your skills.

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:51.920
I...

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:52.680
My Lady,

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:54.000
as the saying goes,

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:55.720
you should always compare
before you buy, right?

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:57.050
Look at this gentleman—

00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:59.160
elegant on the outside,

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:01.600
mysterious on the inside,

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:03.530
and he stands so tall and straight.

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:06.280
I'm simply no match for him.

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:08.880
I'm just average.

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:11.320
Look at this friend here—

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:12.320
so strong.

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:13.120
Look.

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:17.480
Well... My Lady,

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:19.120
you may not know,

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:21.680
but I'm all show.

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:23.320
I'm weak inside,

00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:24.920
and my waist is not good.

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:26.260
If I stand too long,

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:27.450
my legs give out.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:29.560
My Lady,

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:31.200
I sleepwalk.

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:33.000
When I'm asleep, I...

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:36.000
go rummage through junk
in the middle of the night.

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:38.640
Really!

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:39.680
When it gets really bad,

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:40.360
I...

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:41.120
I even...

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:42.120
eat shit.

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:50.680
Then I'll just have to pick the best
from the worst.

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:51.560
Carry on.

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:00.080
Poor Dog,

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:01.920
are you serious?

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:04.320
I'm sorry.

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:07.020
A husband's virtue matters more.

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:11.480
My Lady,

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:13.880
since you have high hopes for me,

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:15.840
I shouldn't hide anything.

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:17.170
I'll tell you the truth.

00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:17.960
I...

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:20.320
was born with only one kidney.

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:21.600
And...

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:23.320
I often lack energy.

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:26.020
I often feel dizzy,
and my ears ring a lot.

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:29.010
I'll see this through with you.

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:30.160
My Lady, I...

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:30.560
My Lady!

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:31.040
I...

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:31.600
I...

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:33.200
I can't see it all of a sudden!

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:35.680
Maybe it's due to lack of energy again.

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:36.320
I...

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:40.840
What?

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:44.580
My Lady, I think he can still be saved.

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:46.600
Celestial Master!

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:47.660
Celestial Master!

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:48.900
Celestial Master!

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:50.160
Celestial Master, wake up!

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:51.240
Wake up!

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:56.650
Since he passed out,

00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:58.680
I'll choose you tonight.

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:00.690
Actually...

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:03.120
I think...

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:04.520
he can be...

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:06.480
s—

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:07.240
saved.

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:11.620
I really think he can be saved.

00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:13.680
He will wake up. Really!

00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:14.400
He...

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:15.460
Celestial Master!

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:16.280
Stop pretending.

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:17.550
Get up!

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:18.680
Stop pretending!

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:19.680
Stop pretending!

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:21.160
Wait,

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:22.280
I...

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:24.880
He can wake up!

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:25.640
Save him,

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:26.640
and he can wake up!

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:27.960
Wait, I...

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:29.160
I have a wife!

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:01.520
Weiyun?

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.080
Why are you here?

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:04.930
Let's talk outside.

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:18.920
Why are you so nervous?

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:19.720
Relax.

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:21.760
It's daytime.

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:23.280
He's...

00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:25.240
not necessarily going serve her
in the bedroom.

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:26.160
Maybe...

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:27.600
They'll...

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:28.840
just talk.

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:30.360
Really?

00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:33.560
Yes.

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:38.700
He wouldn't dare, anyway.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.640
How much does Her Ladyship pay us a month?

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:50.960
If it's too little, I'll quit.

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:52.540
I have a family to support.

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:53.760
I need to raise

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:57.320
some chickens, ducks, fish, geese,
and so on.

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:02.290
They're all no ordinary martial artists.

00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:04.530
This Gulizan really is something.

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:06.200
Yeah.

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:08.160
She has recruited quite a few people

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:09.690
by paying them generously.

00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:10.800
Miss Long,

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:12.760
have you found anything?

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.080
She recruits
not only many humans and demons,

00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:15.940
but also maids.

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:17.530
So I managed to sneak in.

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:18.880
As long as I'm careful,

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:20.160
I won't run into her.

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:23.370
Then you must have found
a lot of information.

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:25.120
We still don't know

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:26.480
who she really is

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:27.810
and what she's up to.

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:28.680
But

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:30.720
there's indeed something wrong

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:32.520
with the experts she recruited.

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:33.850
What's wrong with them?

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:35.840
Many demons with demon power

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:37.690
disappeared shortly after

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:38.980
entering her mansion.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.660
There's a very suspicious place
in her mansion.

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:44.490
We can go take a look.

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:07.000
Look.

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:09.010
An abandoned warehouse

00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:10.620
with masters guarding it.

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:13.890
There must be something wrong with it.

00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:14.800
Don't!

00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:15.800
What are you doing?

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:16.800
Don't act rashly.

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:19.360
I know

00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:21.280
you are in a bad mood.

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:23.200
But I still think

00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:25.060
it's better not to alert them.

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:26.730
It's wiser to be strategic.

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:37.920
Sirs,

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:39.540
what are you doing?

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:40.900
Who are you?

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:43.200
I'm new here today.

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:44.210
I just want to ask

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:46.080
how much our Lady Guli

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:47.460
pays us each month.

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:48.520
I heard

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:50.000
it's quite a lot.

00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:51.200
Go away.

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:53.480
You didn't deny it.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.520
So it really is a lot, huh?

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:56.320
Well...

00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:58.080
I came to the right place.

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:00.520
To be honest,

00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:01.440
I came here

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:02.640
to make money.

00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:04.160
I need to support my family.

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:05.420
What's wrong with you?

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:06.720
Everyone is here to make money.

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:07.320
Right.

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:08.700
That's different.

00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:10.040
I'm not only

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:12.240
making money from Her Ladyship,

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:12.920
but also

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.800
from

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:16.400
all the rich gentlemen here.

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:17.640
Come.

00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:20.160
Come here.

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:24.050
This is a top-grade fox demon whip.

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:25.240
Want it?

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:28.440
Looks like...

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:29.560
you don't need it.

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:40.980
This Celestial Master

00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:42.700
is exactly like Poor Dog said—

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:44.400
full of tricks.

00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:53.320
Come here.

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:56.480
What?

00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:59.410
Want me to come over
and invite you myself?

00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:05.880
Bring me the grapes

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:07.400
on the table.

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:14.680
You're standing so far away.

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:16.010
How am I supposed to eat?

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:17.960
Bring them here.

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:52.520
Sweet?

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:00.620
What kind of demon are you?

00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:06.120
A... corsac fox demon.

00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:12.000
Such a handsome corsac fox demon.

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:14.280
Are you married?

00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:18.960
Xueyang and the Celestial Master
told me to hide my identity,

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:21.240
but they didn't say I should hide
the fact that I'm married.

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:22.440
Do you need

00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:25.240
to think that long to answer?

00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:26.080
I'm married.

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:32.640
Then why are you here in my mansion

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:35.540
instead of being home with your wife?

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:37.160
I need to make money.

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:38.600
But...

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:40.880
I sell my skills, not my body.

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:47.400
Then tell me about your wife

00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:49.680
to entertain me a little.

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:21.380
You're a corsac fox demon?

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:24.160
Save my brother.

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:25.400
I'm begging you.

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:27.080
Calm down.

00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:28.160
Talk to me.

00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:32.320
There's something wrong...

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:33.240
with Gulizan.

00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:36.410
She isn't really recruiting talents.

00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:38.850
All the demons with demon power

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:40.120
who came here

00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:42.980
were taken by her to an unknown place.

00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:44.360
My brother

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:46.240
is one of them.

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:49.460
Where is your brother?

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:50.880
I don't know.

00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:52.640
I only remember

00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:54.680
he went to Gulizan's room

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:56.880
with her,

00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:00.140
and when her yellow scepter flashed,

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:02.080
he disappeared.

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:04.850
Then why are you still here?

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:06.640
That vicious woman said

00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:08.610
the formation is already full.

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:09.610
Once it finishes

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:12.000
absorbing this batch of demons,

00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:15.200
she'll send me in.

00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:17.780
I'll get you out first.

00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:19.000
No.

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:21.040
If you save me,

00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:23.320
it will be exposed.

00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:24.680
And my brother

00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:26.120
will definitely die.

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:30.840
So Gulizan used her scepter

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:33.360
to send many demons into an evil formation

00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:34.480
to absorb their power?

00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:35.080
Yes.

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:37.170
I've fought her before.

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:39.320
That woman's background is unknown,

00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:40.880
and her magic is unfathomable.

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:42.440
If we try to seize the scepter by force,

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:43.800
we might not succeed,

00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:47.090
but the demons inside the formation
will surely die.

00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:48.920
That's right.

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:54.240
We don't have to take it by force.

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:56.520
I suggest

00:31:57.920 --> 00:31:59.480
we use our wits.

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:13.760
Why...

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:16.080
are you all looking at me?

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:19.120
Let me ask you something.

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:20.880
Does Lady Gulizan...

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:22.680
like you?

00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:24.040
No.

00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:25.440
No?

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:26.880
No!

00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:28.400
Be honest with us.

00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:34.320
Well, maybe...

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:34.960
a little.

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:36.320
A little's good enough.

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:37.840
As the saying goes,

00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:40.840
"When Heaven is about to place
a great responsibility on some dog..."

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:41.600
It's okay to make a little sacrifice

00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:43.160
for your people.

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:44.320
You'll use your charm

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:45.520
to steal the scepter,

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:46.960
then Xueyang will disable

00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:49.020
the scepter's teleportation spell.

00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:53.960
I'm not going.

00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:58.000
You have to go.

00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:01.680
[Listen]

00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:04.880
Don't be nervous.

00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:05.760
Relax.

00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:07.880
I've put an eavesdropping talisman here.

00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:09.640
You're not going to do anything naughty.

00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:11.440
There's nothing to be afraid of.

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:13.080
Just follow

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:14.720
what I taught you.

00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:21.040
Sacrifice a little

00:33:21.170 --> 00:33:22.480
for the greater good.

00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:25.080
Right, Weiyun?

00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:29.360
Stop dawdling.

00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:30.280
Go!

00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:39.380
Little Spider,

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:42.180
we can't stay in this damn place forever.

00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:43.720
The plan in the Western Regions

00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:45.250
should be nearly complete.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.360
We need to find a way out.

00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:52.920
Don't worry.

00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:56.890
Everything is going according to my plan.

00:33:58.240 --> 00:33:59.560
Feel it carefully.

00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:02.200
The power on the spell pillar
is weakening.

00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:02.920
I can also feel

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:05.320
the magic in the spiritual chain
is fading.

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:07.800
On the day of the new moon,

00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:12.040
the Grief Tree seed
will inevitably backfire.

00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:14.719
On this day,

00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:17.340
Qingtong's power drops significantly.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.120
If she forcibly refines the tree seed now,

00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:21.639
she'll only harm herself.

00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:27.199
At this time,

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:31.159
her perception of the outside world
is also at its lowest.

00:34:31.199 --> 00:34:32.880
This is Qingtong's weakness.

00:34:33.639 --> 00:34:34.400
Tonight

00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:38.280
is the perfect time for us
to carry out our plan.

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:40.440
I'll help you

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:42.850
break free from this chain.

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:41.320
Qingcheng was right.

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:44.640
Qingtong really is

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:46.360
at her weakest tonight.

00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:08.400
Your Majesty,

00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:10.360
I'm your...

00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:13.210
[Listen]

00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:19.040
Go on.

00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:21.480
Your Majesty,

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:24.520
I'm your admirer.

00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:27.360
Don't you remember it very well?

00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:28.880
Why aren't you saying it?

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:34.390
Why don't you take it?

00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:36.260
[Listen]

00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:38.870
[Listen]

00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:43.360
[Listen]

00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:45.020
Forgot the lines to seduce me?

00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:48.170
The next line after "Your Majesty"

00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:50.560
should be "I am your admirer."

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:52.240
Yes.

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:56.400
I am your admirer.

00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:24.720
I have

00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:26.760
plenty of money,

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:28.400
but

00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:31.720
it depends on your performance.

00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:41.520
My Lady, your scepter is beautiful.

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:42.650
It must be...

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:44.220
v-very expensive, right?

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:45.920
This is my magic tool.

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:48.840
The Snake Demon King's intact bone,

00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:51.380
fused with a red bloodstone refined from

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:53.540
a golden-winged bird demon's heart,

00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:54.640
can amplify spell power

00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:56.160
to the maximum.

00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:01.760
You like that scepter?

00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:04.040
Yes.

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:05.640
I like it very much.

00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:07.400
Then...

00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:09.760
go take a look.

00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:20.050
[Listen]

00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:51.800
You wouldn't be interested in this scepter

00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:53.680
and want to take it, would you?

00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:56.760
N-

00:38:57.320 --> 00:38:58.120
no.

00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:00.840
How about

00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:03.800
I teach you how to make this scepter

00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:04.960
glow?

00:39:06.210 --> 00:39:07.280
What do you mean?

00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:15.680
Fan Yunfei,

00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:20.610
you're cautious
and have strong demon power.

00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:22.640
It took me a lot of effort

00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:25.440
to teleport you
into the Myriad Blight Formation.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:26.600
Oh no.

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:28.050
We've been tricked.

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:32.640
Traitors in Corsac Fox State

00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:35.080
must die!

00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:48.200
Where did you take my Yunfei?

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.800
Quan Rumu, Master Quan.

00:39:57.680 --> 00:39:58.800
Long Weiyun,

00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:00.760
the last True Dragon.

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:03.080
Li Xueyang, General Li.

00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:04.720
Nice to meet you.

00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:06.360
You...

00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:08.640
You know us?

00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:35.170
What formation is this?

00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:39.080
Is it absorbing my demon power
to activate the formation?

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.000
It's using me as the formation core?

00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:18.840
Power of Hatred.

00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:21.120
Endless Power of Hatred!

00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:22.920
Grief Tree,

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:24.960
absorb all the power

00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:26.760
and grow quickly!

00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:28.820
I've been waiting for this day

00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:30.880
for a long time!

00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:37.320
The Myriad Blight Formation
has finally been activated.

00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:39.440
Once I've regained my strength,

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.480
Wangquan Hongye,

00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:43.640
Wangquan Fugui—

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:45.040
both of you

00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:47.520
will die.
