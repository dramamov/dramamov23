[Sword and Beloved]

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.700
[Episode 30]

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:57.400
We made it.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:05.040
Miss Long.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:07.590
Thank you.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.560
Where is Rumu?

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:15.790
Celestial Master...

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.760
He's still with Gulizan.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:18.490
Let's go.

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:25.970
Celestial Master,

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.210
may misfortunes never befall you.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.079
The peace of the Western Regions

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:32.280
needs to be maintained by the four of us.

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:41.140
Celestial Master?

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.290
What happened?

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.360
Nothing.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.030
I...

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.360
I was being too anxious.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.630
What kind of stunt is he pulling?

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.190
We can't let this situation go on.

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.310
I've heard that in the Western Regions,

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.030
there's a mouth-to-mouth
energy transferring method.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.360
It may help him restore spiritual energy

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.310
and wake him up.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:12.840
Good job,

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.990
my dear disciple.

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.630
Poor Dog,

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:15.560
are you sure of that?

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.470
Yes, I'm sure.

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.150
Master and I read about the secret art
of the Western Regions.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.010
The book does record
this method.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:25.910
Miss Long,

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.400
don't members of the Dragon Clan
all have good medical skills?

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.329
Why don't you...

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.150
Miss Long,

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:36.520
at this point,

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.160
there isn't a better option.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.240
What’s wrong, Miss Long?

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:13.800
You two…

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:16.120
I got it.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.649
Poor Dog, come out with me.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.570
Why do you have to be so nosy?

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.870
Stop looking at them!

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.750
I'm not!

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:15.850
Weiyun,

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:17.800
what

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:19.560
was ringing just now?

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.550
Nothing was ringing.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.180
You heard it wrong.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.780
Was that so?

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:30.490
But I heard it

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.630
quite clearly.

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:35.650
Now that you've recovered,

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:36.710
I should get going.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:37.750
Weiyun!

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.630
Weiyun!

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:40.610
Where are you going?

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.720
The task I promised to tackle with you
has been completed.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.120
Of course I'm leaving for
where I should be.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:51.190
Miss Long,

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:52.450
where are you heading?

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:53.970
Are you leaving right now?

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.000
Yes.

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.560
To celebrate the victory against Gulizan

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.750
and the fact

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:02.870
that we can continue defending
the Western Regions,

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.390
Xueyang is holding a party
at the military camp tonight.

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.830
Right.

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.510
Won't it be nice to drink,
sing, and watch the moon

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:09.210
together?

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:10.870
Yeah, Weiyun.

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:12.720
Don't you want to go with me

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.920
and make friends with the like-minded?

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.430
That's right, Miss Long.

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:18.720
We've just built good rapport
between each other.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.190
Why not stay and celebrate

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:21.480
with us tonight?

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:22.870
Please stay.

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:57.600
-Come on!
-Come on!

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:58.800
Fill up your glasses.

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.720
To the four of us

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.360
defeating Gulizan with concerted efforts

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:09.950
and safeguarding the peace
of the Western Regions.

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:10.830
Cheers!

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:11.480
Cheers!

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.680
Cheers, Miss Long.

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:13.340
Bottoms up.

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:31.070
Weiyun,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.060
I've never seen you

00:07:33.409 --> 00:07:34.430
smile so happily.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:39.870
Given General Li's utter hospitality,

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:41.510
I surely must enjoy this party.

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:43.040
Don't read too much into it.

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.090
In addition,

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:49.270
after tonight,

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.120
you'll have to stop following me.

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:53.190
How can I stop?

00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:56.720
Come on.

00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:58.190
Let's drink.

00:07:58.190 --> 00:07:58.950
Come on, have a drink.

00:07:58.950 --> 00:07:59.430
Let's drink.

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:00.160
Drink up.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.470
There's a hot pot here?

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:05.680
What a great atmosphere tonight!

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.070
Why not dance with us?

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:08.160
Let's do it!

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:08.890
Come with me!

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:09.680
Guys!

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:10.040
Move!

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.120
Boss is joining us!

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:11.750
I can't dance.

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:13.600
-Go. What do you mean you can't dance?
-Miss Long, come along.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:14.360
No more dawdling. Hurry!

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.820
I've never danced before.

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:16.630
Let's go!

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:19.180
Come on.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.120
Let's

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.240
dance!

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:23.080
Weiyun,

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:25.690
I saw a bracelet on the way here.

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:27.150
I thought it'd definitely

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:28.150
look great on you.

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:34.770
Weiyun, in your heart,

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:36.630
I'm never the only one.

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:40.330
But I won't forget each and every word

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:41.790
you've said.

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:21.650
Are you alright?

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:31.920
Young Master Fugui,

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:34.670
suppose

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:37.270
we become stronger

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:39.860
through cultivation,

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:44.030
but only end up

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:49.150
losing the person we care most about.

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.630
Then what's the meaning

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:57.960
of our cultivation?

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:07.030
As Zhang Qi once said,

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:09.510
making a compromise

00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:14.290
with this chaotic world
shouldn't be the purpose of cultivation.

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:15.440
Qingtong,

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:18.030
rebuild the Peach Village here.

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:21.530
Let all the helpless souls adrift
in troubled times

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:24.270
have a place to call home.

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:38.750
This is a proclamation from the governor
of Qianji City to the world—

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:38.830
This city invites

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:40.360
[Edict]

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.290
those of insight and vision to come

00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:46.050
and inaugurate a prosperous era
where humans and demons coexist.

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:48.960
From today on,

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:50.200
all the humans and demons

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.720
that choose to settle in Qianji City

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.080
will be considered comrades

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.540
and protected by the city.

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:01.140
With Master by Miss Qingtong's side,

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.560
Qianji City will surely become
the best city of all times.

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:06.010
Poor Dog.

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:08.390
We must work hard too.

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:09.390
Yes,

00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:10.360
My Love!

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:12.910
Aren't you silly?

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:21.030
[Edict]

00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:21.730
Master,

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.790
Senior Fugui and Qingtong
have made huge contributions.

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:25.670
They not only found

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:27.750
the culprit
behind the Night of Frost's Descent

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:29.880
and thus solved Elder Shouren's case,

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:30.910
but also

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.600
destroyed the Myriad Blight Formation
in time

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.060
to prevent a catastrophe.

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:39.000
It takes actual actions to create

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:40.880
a prosperous and peaceful era.

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.390
It has to be like this,

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:47.550
starting from a small city.

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:51.550
As long as

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:53.840
there's hope in the heart,

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:56.850
even a single spark
can start a prairie fire.

00:12:57.390 --> 00:12:58.080
Master,

00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:00.230
put your mind at ease.

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:02.010
Everything is looking up.

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.090
Young Master Fugui.

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:34.840
Yes?

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:36.420
It's late at night.

00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:38.450
Still working on the compass?

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:40.980
I'm doing okay.

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:44.810
Did you drink alcohol?

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:49.650
Is the smell too strong?

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:51.240
I did drink a bit.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.440
Are there no humans or demons

00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:05.250
migrating to Qianji City?

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:09.910
There are.

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:12.080
It's just not that many.

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:15.040
Every now and then,
there comes a new resident.

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:16.600
One is a boar demon

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:18.400
that weighs over 100 kilograms.

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.530
He eats 20 steamed buns in one meal.

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:24.910
Everything takes time.

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:27.960
Zhang Qi spent seven years

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:30.170
building up the Peach Village.

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:31.840
To build Qianji City

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:34.090
into a shelter like the Peach Village,

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:37.180
there's still a long way for you to go.

00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:39.030
Got it.

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:42.330
Young Master Fugui,

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:44.720
how's it going with the study
of the magic tool

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:46.320
that can track the Black Fox?

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:50.190
I guess I've made some progress.

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:53.120
If this compass is successfully developed,

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:55.180
it'll detect the Black Fox's energy.

00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:56.680
But before that,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.860
there's a long way for me to go too.

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:15.360
Hangover cures

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:17.790
are all bitter.

00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:42.830
You solved the problem yourself

00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:44.200
and saved your brother.

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:45.320
Qingtong,

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:47.120
your efforts weren't in vain.

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:48.580
Then, Young Master Fugui,

00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:50.600
shouldn't you

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:53.080
reward me with some candy?

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:04.330
The candy has indeed

00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:06.880
made me feel better.

00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:31.290
The mission was already completed.

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:32.870
Yet you're still following me.

00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:33.550
Why?

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:35.670
I'm here

00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:38.000
to verify one thing.

00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:41.150
I know

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:44.150
the Dragon Bone Bell rings

00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:49.000
when you fall in love.

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:52.630
Previously, at the Li Army's camp,

00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:54.150
I heard the bell ring.

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:55.760
Very clearly.

00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:58.330
You heard an imaginary sound.

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:00.690
I don't believe it.

00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:01.650
How about this?

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:03.490
Let me take a look at the bell

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:04.730
for confirmation.

00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:06.609
Why would I let you?

00:17:09.109 --> 00:17:10.109
You dare not do it.

00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:13.690
Because I said it right, didn't I?

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:28.109
Do you hear it?

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:29.830
It's not ringing.

00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:31.470
Will you just give up?

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:34.730
It shouldn't be like this.

00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:57.790
I know what the problem is!

00:17:57.790 --> 00:17:59.240
This must be it—

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:02.070
I don't look cool enough
in this posture right now.

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:03.000
Give me a moment.

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:18.210
What about now?

00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:19.830
Has the bell rung?

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:30.440
I'll adjust my posture.

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:36.440
One, two, three!

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:42.400
Now,

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:43.920
it should be ringing.

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:55.070
T-The bell

00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:56.160
must be broken.

00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:57.200
Or perhaps...

00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:58.510
it has been affected

00:18:58.510 --> 00:18:59.510
by today's

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:00.960
bad weather.

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:01.880
Right?

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:04.720
Right.

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:09.590
Weiyun,

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:10.640
look!

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:13.240
Auspicious iridescent clouds!

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:28.480
So beautiful.

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:36.880
It's said

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:40.200
that such clouds come with good news.

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.830
Does it mean...

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:45.310
we...

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:53.640
Anyway,

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:55.840
I've thought it through.

00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:58.400
From now on,

00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:01.110
I will never part with you again.

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:03.770
It was my fault for stupidly

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:04.590
saying

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:06.530
that I'd leave you alone

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:07.880
and set you free.

00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:09.750
I was being foolish.

00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:11.640
I said that nonsense

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:13.170
in the moment of silliness.

00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:14.550

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:08.110
Freeze!

00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:09.830
Keep up!

00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:10.270
Stop!

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:12.820
Hurry up! Hurry!

00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:13.310
Catch him!

00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:13.680
This way!

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:14.240
Stop!

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:15.880
Stop!

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:16.550
Keep up!

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:17.440
Stop!

00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:18.550
Stop!

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:20.200
Stop!

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:21.510
Stop!

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:22.570
How dare you run?

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.990
Chongming bird demons
and members of prestigious families,

00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:45.850
why are you chasing after a child?

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:47.750
That boy

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:51.400
is the son
of a Chongming bird demon and my senior.

00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:52.570
He shouldn't live!

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:56.350
We the Chongming bird demons
are highly talented.

00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:58.640
How can we let humans
take advantage of us?

00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:00.100
It's against nature to let

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:01.790
this half-human half-demon live!

00:27:01.790 --> 00:27:02.590
Nature?

00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:05.160
Don't try to frame it on the nature.

00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:07.470
Girl demon,

00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:08.890
do you have a death wish or what?

00:27:08.890 --> 00:27:11.600
Qianji City is a shelter
for humans and demons in need.

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:12.830
Killings are to be avoided here.

00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:14.830
If you don't want to lose your lives,

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:16.440
scram now.

00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:20.070
You are

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:22.440
the Qianji City Lord?

00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:23.920
So what if I am?

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:26.400
You cowards!

00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:29.310
Powerful though Qianji City is,

00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:31.280
it's not invincible, is it?

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:32.920
Guys, charge!

00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:55.810
Young Master Fugui,

00:27:56.030 --> 00:27:57.360
let's take the boy back.

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:05.960
Little Bun,

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:08.440
cry if you want.

00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:12.480
I can't cry.

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:14.240
When I cry,

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:15.640
blood appears.

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:17.920
Then they'll recognize me.

00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:24.990
It's indeed a feature

00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:28.490
of Chongming bird demons.

00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:32.430
Tell me.

00:28:33.310 --> 00:28:34.510
Where is your father?

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:35.750
He...

00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:37.680
was beaten

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:40.740
to death by bad people.

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:42.120
Sir,

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:44.790
why do they dislike me?

00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:47.590
Is it because I don't behave well enough?

00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:48.440
I swear

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:50.310
I'll eat carrots from now on.

00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:51.830
I won't be picky anymore.

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:56.420
You've behaved well enough, Little Bun.

00:28:57.030 --> 00:28:58.430
Those bad guys just enjoy

00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:00.070
bullying you.

00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:03.250
Go to sleep.

00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:04.550
Don't worry.

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:06.440
I'm here for you.

00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:08.510
But I'm scared.

00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:10.310
Sir,

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:12.240
can you

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.270
sing me to sleep?

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:17.590
I'm not

00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:19.640
much good at singing.

00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:22.110
How about I recite

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:25.360
some lines from a sword manual instead?

00:29:26.270 --> 00:29:26.830
Okay.

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:30.940
"Spread your arms like a phoenix
to intimidate the enemy."

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:34.500
"Aim for the shoulders
and attack from both sides."

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:37.370
“Make your sword move
like dancing snowflakes.”

00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:40.280
"With that you can fend off
many an opponent."

00:29:41.030 --> 00:29:43.750
"Charge with an elegant gait
as you launch a fatal strike "

00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:47.280
"Blades will meet in a shower of sparks
as bright as moonlight."

00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:10.160
Qingcheng,

00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:11.830
do you see?

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.510
Our ideal of a home

00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:16.750
is being built little by little.

00:30:17.790 --> 00:30:18.920
I will try my best.

00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:21.070
The coexistence of humans and demons

00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:22.000
won't be a dream.

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:33.310
I didn't expect Young Master Fugui

00:30:33.310 --> 00:30:35.400
to lull the boy to sleep by reciting lines

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:36.530
from a sword manual.

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:56.620
Is this nerve-soothing soup?

00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:58.200
Yes.

00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:02.160
Chongming bird demons
get frightened easily.

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:04.960
I'm afraid
regular nerve-soothing soup won't do.

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:06.270
Look,

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:07.590
tomorrow,

00:31:08.790 --> 00:31:10.650
I'll go collect some other herbs.

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:12.200
Okay.

00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:34.590
Master.

00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:42.240
The medicine prescribed by Dr. Xin

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:44.070
is indeed very potent.

00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:48.280
I can't believe I just fell asleep.

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:53.640
Is it time to set out

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:56.550
for the selection of a new alliance chief?

00:31:57.310 --> 00:31:58.350
Yes, Master.

00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:00.550
But I have a report to make now.

00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:02.440
Go ahead.

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:04.550
A few days ago,

00:32:04.550 --> 00:32:06.790
the young master saved a kid
that's half human and half demon.

00:32:06.790 --> 00:32:07.440
The news

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:09.370
has been spread to both realms.

00:32:23.790 --> 00:32:24.480
Is he

00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:27.030
still in Qianji City?

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:28.440
Yes.

00:32:32.030 --> 00:32:34.230
The peach blossoms in the Peach Village

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.790
have been truly deeply rooted

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:39.030
in his heart.

00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:40.680
Master,

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.160
since you've decided

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:44.070
to pass the position of chief
to a promising young member

00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:45.240
of Yiqi Alliance,

00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:47.610
why not ask the young master to come back?

00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:50.160
Those stubborn old men
who were against him

00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:51.310
have all gone by now.

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:55.880
I have

00:32:56.960 --> 00:33:00.200
devoted my entire life to Yiqi Alliance.

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:06.070
But, Shuang,

00:33:07.510 --> 00:33:08.920
right now,

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:14.070
I just want to be a selfish father

00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:16.750
and let Fugui

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:19.830
grow the peach blossom in his heart.

00:33:22.030 --> 00:33:22.920
Isn't it nice?

00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:31.510
Maybe not meeting

00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:34.350
with each other again is the best ending

00:33:34.350 --> 00:33:36.080
for him and me as father and son.

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:01.110
Soldier,

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:04.340
do you admit your mistake?

00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:05.640
I did nothing wrong.

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:07.880
If he doesn't admit,

00:34:08.670 --> 00:34:10.480
keep him hanging until he does.

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:15.010
Father, don't blame yourself.

00:34:16.150 --> 00:34:18.150
I've long anticipated and prepared

00:34:18.150 --> 00:34:20.409
for everything that has happened today.

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:22.710
I just hope you can understand

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:25.030
the Way I deem right.

00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:29.230
Fugui,

00:34:30.070 --> 00:34:33.070
it seems our last parting
has turned out to be forever.

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:35.190
I may not

00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:36.760
live to see

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:39.219
the day you practice the Way
with your sword.

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:41.760
[In the spring of that year,]

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:44.000
[Wangquan Hongye
the chief of Yiqi Alliance]

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.150
[voluntarily stepped down
from his position]

00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:48.949
[and let the young members
compete for it fairly.]

00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:51.590
[After 3 contests in
physical strength, skills, and willpower,]

00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:53.550
[Dongfang Yuechu stood out]

00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:55.120
[and became the new chief.]

00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:55.960
[Wangquan]

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:58.890
[Meanwhile,
the legendary mysterious Qianji City]

00:34:59.190 --> 00:35:02.510
[became a real shelter
for humans and demons in trouble.]

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:08.110
Quan Jingting,

00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:09.920
Gulizan lost.

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:12.230
Madam Black Fox is very disappointed.

00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:12.920
What?

00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:14.960
Madam has thought of me again,

00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:16.360
her indispensable aide?

00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:23.190
Quan Jingting,

00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:26.730
Madam is giving you a chance
to make up for your mistake.

00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:30.110
Though Gulizan's body and soul
have vanished,

00:35:30.110 --> 00:35:31.920
she did leave something behind.

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:35.190
You'll regain your power with its help.

00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:36.110
But you must

00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:37.760
clear all the barriers

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:40.280
for Madam.

00:35:42.850 --> 00:35:45.110
How thoughtful and farsighted Madam is.

00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:47.960
I promise I won't let her down.

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:40.340
Whether I can change my fate or not

00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:42.550
depends on this one move.

00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:35.960
As I expected,

00:37:37.090 --> 00:37:40.760
you can't recreate
a complete Myriad Blight Formation,

00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:44.320
but you can

00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:48.150
assist me in absorbing power.

00:37:48.590 --> 00:37:50.550
The power is not enough, though.

00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:54.590
I'll take you to the Dragon Cave

00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:57.420
where you can take in
plenty of dragon power.

00:37:59.590 --> 00:38:01.150
I, Quan Jingting,

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:05.440
will rise again.

00:38:09.630 --> 00:38:11.070
My rebellious son...
