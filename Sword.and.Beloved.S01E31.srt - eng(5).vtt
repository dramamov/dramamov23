00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.550
[Episode 31]

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:56.430
As I expected,

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.350
even though you can't replicate
the full Myriad Blight Formation,

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.760
you can still help me

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.590
draw power.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.420
But this amount of power
still isn't enough.

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.800
I'll take you to the Dragon Cave

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.860
and let you take in
your fill of dragon power.

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:41.230
Qingtong?

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:42.670
What brings you here?

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.680
I was worried
the rain might start suddenly,

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.540
so I came to bring you an umbrella.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.630
It's okay.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.560
You've troubled yourself for me again.

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:01.710
I've never seen you like this before,
Young Master Fugui,

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:02.680
and I never knew

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.800
that you actually knew
how to gather herbs.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.150
Do you think

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.430
the version of me who sat in the Palanquin

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:11.710
while slaying demons

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.240
suits me better?

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:16.970
It's not like that.

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.910
Qingtong.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.329
Look at this Blood-Breaking Elixir Flower.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.800
If it can fully mature,

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.710
it can save the lives of
more humans and demons.

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:32.400
Remember

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.310
to come back and dig it up in 3 months.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.079
Okay.

I am.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.800
Why do you ask, Young Master Fugui?

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.680
No matter how fine a sword is,

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.560
it will bear marks once it's been used.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.480
Different marks

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.480
represent different experiences.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.690

Why did you do that?

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:37.480
That Hongye under the mask

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:39.540
is already dead!

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:41.590
He died beyond the circle,

00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:43.910
under that black Grief Tree!

00:30:44.270 --> 00:30:45.960
Your closest friends and loved ones

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:47.820
dying one by one before your eyes—

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.930
do you know what that sight is like?

00:30:50.810 --> 00:30:53.010
That Hongye underneath the Jinlan Mask

00:30:53.270 --> 00:30:54.930
lost because of his emotions.

00:30:55.410 --> 00:30:57.590
He'll never forgive himself!

00:30:58.790 --> 00:31:01.310
I won't allow you to follow in
his footsteps!

00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:08.350
At that time,

00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:11.070
you must have thought

00:31:12.030 --> 00:31:13.960
that I hated you, right?

00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:16.020
So

00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:17.680
what did you think

00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:20.880
I hated you for?

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:23.590
I thought

00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:27.790
it was because Mother died because of me

00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:31.240
that you hated me, Father.

00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:44.550
I don't hate you at all.

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:49.070
When you put on that mask that day,

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:53.310
what I saw

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:55.510
was myself.

00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:00.160
The one I wanted to strangle to death

00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:03.110
was myself.

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:15.310
Because

00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:18.590
I've never been able to forgive myself.

00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:22.400
Why was it that the Mask Group
was nearly wiped out,

00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:24.130
Quzhuo returned half-alive,

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:26.170
and yet only I came back unscathed?

00:32:26.790 --> 00:32:29.110
Why did the crisis of the Yiqi Alliance

00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:32.070
have to be resolved
at the cost of Huaizhu's life?

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:34.720
Why did the things we,
the older generation,

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:36.030
failed to accomplish

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:38.290
have to be achieved by sacrificing you

00:32:38.650 --> 00:32:40.720
and putting you through so much pain?

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:50.310
That's why I hate.

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:54.240
I hate myself.

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:02.400
Back then,

00:33:04.030 --> 00:33:06.240
everyone in our Mask Group

00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:10.270
had made thorough preparations

00:33:12.150 --> 00:33:14.410
before trying to break out of the circle.

00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:17.960
But in the end,

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.960
we still lost.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.730
The Black Fox is a master of
manipulating hearts.

00:33:26.030 --> 00:33:28.920
Kinship, friendship, love—

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:30.750
she turns them all

00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:33.080
into her blades.

00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:35.310
In the end,

00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:40.010
they all met their ruin beyond the circle.

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:48.480
At that time, I thought

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:50.900
it was love and attachment

00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:53.930
that brought about our defeat.

00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:58.160
Father, all this time,

00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:04.040
you've made me keep my heart and body
in utter simplicity...

00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:06.940
Because you feared
I'd be undone by emotions,

00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:08.400
the same way you once were.

00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:20.110
Fugui.

00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:22.969
All I hoped for

00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:26.320
was that you would return alive

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:30.620
after fighting the Black Fox
beyond the circle.

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:36.110
I naively thought

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:40.630
that as long as you could come back alive,

00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:44.880
I could slowly make up for

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:48.230
everything I owed you.

00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:56.070
But reality

00:34:57.690 --> 00:34:59.030
proved me wrong.

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:03.630
Who in the world could return

00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:06.890
those 20-some years
you spent in loneliness to you?

00:35:11.590 --> 00:35:13.840
Why must you bear the burden of

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:17.550
my devotion to the Way, to duty,

00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:20.800
and to all living beings?

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:26.360
I was wrong.

00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:28.920
So very, utterly wrong.

00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:32.000
Father...

00:35:54.070 --> 00:35:55.190
Is this...

00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:57.600
the Bamboo Pavilion by River Huai?

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.070
Young Master Fugui

00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:05.280
has always wanted to visit
the Bamboo Pavilion by River Huai.

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:06.190
I wonder

00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:10.000
if what I've woven looks anything like it.

00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:11.320
It does.

00:36:16.070 --> 00:36:17.280
It looks a lot like it.

00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:20.920
Father!

00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:21.760
Uncle Hongye!

00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:22.550
Father.

00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:24.710
It's...

00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:25.910
It's nothing.

00:36:29.110 --> 00:36:30.150
I'm fine.

00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:31.920
Fugui.

00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:35.110
Come with me

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.060
to the Bamboo Pavilion by River Huai,

00:36:40.590 --> 00:36:41.590
will you?

00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:49.710
Okay.
