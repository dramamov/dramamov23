♫Every time the old's replaced with a new one♫

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.884
Ever since the day I met you,

00:01:55.918 --> 00:01:58.320
I've felt like we're connected
in some kind of way.

00:01:58.495 --> 00:02:01.015
It's almost like I've met you before.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.160
The three of us were the Benders
from the legend of Tambralinga.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.080
We are bound by the past.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.840
We will bathe the Shiva lingam quartz
and the Yoni stone in moonlight

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.360
to worship Siva,

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.360
for the Lord will graciously
open up the way to the city.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.360
Om...

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.880
Hey!

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.040
What's that?

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.720
Let's go check it out.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Hey, don't go near it!

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.051
Why can't we?

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.661
We have no idea what it is.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:01.640
- Hey!
- Hold on.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.312
Hey!

00:05:23.352 --> 00:05:24.520
No way!

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.252
Hey!

00:05:26.427 --> 00:05:27.913
How's this possible?!

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.900
Run!

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.000
Bring the stones back.

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:52.560
Get the necklaces.

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:10.740
Come back here!

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:13.400
I said come back here!

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.120
Hurry. Get in the car.

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.400
Professor!

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:26.560
Professor.

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:31.400
Come back!

00:07:34.353 --> 00:07:37.353
The atman of Kalakal within me
has yet to awaken.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:38.880
Come back!!

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.480
I said come back!!

00:07:52.019 --> 00:07:54.479
Did you hear the roar
when the lightning struck?

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:56.960
Yeah, I did.

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:01.760
What could Professor Thakoon be after,

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:04.040
performing the ritual with these two stones?

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.760
We already had both stones in our hands...

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:23.240
Damn it!

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:25.097
Professor...

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:31.240
At least now I know
that the Shiva lingam and the Yoni stone

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:34.040
could lead us back to Tambralinga.

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.600
If they hadn't taken the stones back,

00:08:36.421 --> 00:08:38.800
I would've awakened the atman of Kalakal!

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.520
Through Kalakal's ancient memo...

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
and the ruins I once stood upon,

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.280
I've come to believe that

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.440
every clue I uncover

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.800
will bring to light the past glory of Kalakal,

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:01.600
the Earth Bender of Tambralinga.

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:09.760
Could it be that...

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:12.920
he's also one of the Benders?

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.120
But when the lightning struck,

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:17.160
he didn't show any signs like we did.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.640
That roar...

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:25.280
made me feel like...

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:27.320
the ritual

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.720
just woke something up.

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:33.320
The worst part is...

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:35.560
he's witnessed the powers we possess.

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:40.080
So that means...

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:42.640
the fall of Tambralinga

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.920
was caused by the loss of its equilibrium.

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.560
What really happened
thousands of years ago?

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:53.120
Suriya, Asuni, and Apo rose up against Kalakal.

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:01.600
The memo from the Tang dynasty archives

00:10:02.366 --> 00:10:03.994
mentions a place called Danmaling,

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:05.520
or Tambralinga,

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:10.400
after the city's mysterious disappearance.

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:14.640
It was once said that Tambralinga
was stronger than any other kingdom,

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:19.080
for it was ruled by Kalakal, the mighty warrior
who possessed the power of earth

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.880
and ruled as the supreme sovereign.

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.320
However, the other three Benders,

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:28.520
Suriya, Asuni, and Apo rebelled against him,

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:32.280
casting a Vedic mantra

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:35.400
to sever his atman

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:38.360
and hide it within a sacred land.

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:42.356
When the equilibrium
of the four elements was broken,

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:44.760
Tambralinga collapsed,

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:46.800
was swallowed by the earth

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.660
and buried for eternity.

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:54.840
As of today,

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:59.200
I've done everything I could
to bring the four elements together again.

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:01.760
And once you've gathered them all,

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:05.400
what will you do?

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:13.080
Right this way!

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.120
- God...
- Wait...

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:15.440
What happened to him?

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:16.720
Wait, what's that?

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.200
He wasn't like this
the last time I saw him.

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:21.560
What happened?

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:23.480
I have no idea.

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.280
The lightning was striking nonstop,

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:28.200
and when he touched that box,
he ended up like this.

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:35.760
We found a dead man.

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:37.000
Notify the police immediately.

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:41.520
Wait...

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:44.320
Where did they go?

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:47.172
What? Where are they?

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:49.120
- Go find them!
- Okay.

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:13.600
Damn, it's too early for this.

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.480
I'm gonna throw up Tambralinga at this point.

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:20.960
I've never had to read this much
in my entire life.

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.320
Yeah, 'cause you're an idiot.

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:28.040
Oh, please.
You almost didn't graduate, just like me.

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:35.320
Still, Professor Thakoon
probably knows a lot more than we do.

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.360
At least now we know what he's capable of.

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:40.000
We must be careful.

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:42.567
If anything happens,
we tell each other right away.

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:44.000
So we can handle it together.

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:48.000
Guys!

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:49.440
We've got an urgent case in Phatthalung.

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:50.520
Finally!

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:51.520
- Let's go!
- Come on!

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:53.180
Let's go! Let's go!

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:54.157
Can I come with you?

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:54.991
Come on.

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.120
Let's go.

00:13:04.726 --> 00:13:06.766
- Quick, quick, quick.
- Has our network reported in yet?

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:08.520
Three locals went into the forest to forage.

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:09.550
One was found dead in a strange way

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:11.000
where lightning struck last night.

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.280
Where lightning struck last night?

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:13.680
What about the other two?

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:15.880
They went to get help from the rangers

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.600
but vanished and lost contact completely.

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.880
The rangers searched the area
but found no trace,

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:22.000
so they asked us to back them up.

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:24.440
Any photos or leads?

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:27.640
There's one last photo the rangers sent
before the two disappeared.

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:28.600
I'll send it to you.

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:29.520
Shit,

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:31.080
someone got struck by lightning?

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:32.240
That's terrifying.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:33.560
- Quick, quick, quick.
- We're leaving.

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:34.720
- Be careful.
- Okay.

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:36.040
- Got it.
- Take care of yourselves, okay?

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:37.640
- Okay, Mom.
- See you later.

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:38.440
Come on.

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:45.440
Chief, let's go!

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:47.040
Take care of yourselves, everyone!

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:56.280
[The park rangers were notified

They're helping with a case in Phatthalung.

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.160
Is it this one?

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:23.680
Yes, Professor.

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:39.960
This part of the forest
is veiled by unseen powers.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.160
That's why Khun's performing
the unveiling ritual

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:44.520

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:45.680

- Hello.
- Hi.

00:15:18.468 --> 00:15:19.468
What's the situation?

00:15:19.768 --> 00:15:22.068
Three locals went into the forest
to forage last night.

00:15:22.508 --> 00:15:23.908
One was killed by lightning.

00:15:24.548 --> 00:15:26.228
The other two went missing,

00:15:26.588 --> 00:15:27.748
and we still haven't found them.

00:15:28.068 --> 00:15:29.388

00:15:29.628 --> 00:15:30.548
Yeah.

00:15:30.748 --> 00:15:34.348
We've been searching for them all night,
but there's still no sign of them.

00:15:42.148 --> 00:15:43.788
Take me to where lightning struck.

00:15:44.308 --> 00:15:45.308
Sure. Come on.

00:15:49.828 --> 00:15:50.868
Is everything okay?

00:15:54.228 --> 00:15:55.228
I'm not sure.

00:15:56.108 --> 00:15:56.988
I don't think...

00:15:57.108 --> 00:15:59.108
that lightning strike was a coincidence.

00:16:01.068 --> 00:16:03.508
It must have something to do with our past.

00:16:36.748 --> 00:16:39.508
There are no wounds other than burn marks.

00:16:39.908 --> 00:16:41.308
It's just my assumption, though.

00:16:42.728 --> 00:16:44.188
From the way his body's positioned,

00:16:44.228 --> 00:16:45.388
I'd say he died in terror.

00:16:46.528 --> 00:16:48.748
Could it be that
he was attacked by a wild animal?

00:16:50.628 --> 00:16:51.988
That's impossible.

00:16:52.448 --> 00:16:53.748
There are no signs of that.

00:16:54.028 --> 00:16:54.788
You idiot.

00:16:54.828 --> 00:16:55.711
You moron.

00:16:57.748 --> 00:17:00.668
Let's split up and search for the other two.

00:17:01.868 --> 00:17:03.188
I think...

00:17:03.508 --> 00:17:05.548
if they're still alive,
they can't be far from here.

00:17:06.868 --> 00:17:07.788
I agree.

00:17:11.568 --> 00:17:12.868
Mind, Siwat, you stay.

00:17:13.648 --> 00:17:14.868
We'll divide into two teams.

00:17:17.128 --> 00:17:18.388
But here's what bothers me...

00:17:19.788 --> 00:17:22.828
Boat said they searched all night
and still couldn't find them.

00:17:25.988 --> 00:17:27.428
Could it be that the forest...

00:17:28.548 --> 00:17:29.548
- is hiding itself?
- Is hiding itself?

00:17:30.108 --> 00:17:31.762
The forest is hiding itself?

00:17:34.088 --> 00:17:35.188
Get ready.

00:17:35.228 --> 00:17:36.228
I'm starting the ritual.

00:17:53.828 --> 00:17:56.268
This part of the forest
is veiled by unseen powers.

00:17:56.908 --> 00:17:59.148
That's why Khun's performing
the unveiling ritual

00:17:59.588 --> 00:18:01.028
to lead us to the missing.

00:19:04.908 --> 00:19:06.748
I have a feeling danger's waiting for us.

00:19:09.188 --> 00:19:10.308
Be careful.

00:19:10.908 --> 00:19:11.731
Okay.

00:19:12.488 --> 00:19:14.108
You two, stay here and secure the scene.

00:19:14.148 --> 00:19:15.908
The rest of you, go get a stretcher.

00:19:16.428 --> 00:19:17.748
- This way. Follow me.
- Okay.

00:21:19.108 --> 00:21:20.108
That's him!

00:21:31.988 --> 00:21:33.148
He's dead.

00:21:34.428 --> 00:21:35.428
Sh*t...

00:21:36.348 --> 00:21:37.708
I think we're on the right track.

00:21:38.508 --> 00:21:40.028
The other local should be around here.

00:21:40.148 --> 00:21:41.148
He might still be alive.

00:21:41.628 --> 00:21:42.588
I'll go find him myself.

00:21:42.628 --> 00:21:43.268
Hey!

00:21:44.028 --> 00:21:44.948
I'm coming with you.

00:21:46.228 --> 00:21:47.108
Come on, Kor.

00:21:47.508 --> 00:21:48.948
No need. Just stay here.

00:21:49.148 --> 00:21:50.148
Leave it to me.

00:21:50.308 --> 00:21:51.508
You're so good, huh?

00:21:56.588 --> 00:21:57.788
What killed him?

00:21:58.728 --> 00:22:00.068
Hard to tell for now.

00:22:00.108 --> 00:22:01.988
We'll need to wait for the autopsy report.

00:22:06.449 --> 00:22:07.428
One of them is found dead.

00:22:07.468 --> 00:22:08.468
We need backup now.

00:22:47.168 --> 00:22:47.988
Hey!

00:22:50.388 --> 00:22:51.188
Hey!

00:22:55.028 --> 00:22:55.828
Hey.

00:22:58.028 --> 00:22:59.028
Are you okay?

00:22:59.948 --> 00:23:00.708
Look...

00:23:00.948 --> 00:23:01.708
Hey!

00:23:10.188 --> 00:23:11.868
Help me!

00:23:15.548 --> 00:23:16.788
Help!

00:23:32.028 --> 00:23:33.308
Help me!

00:23:35.908 --> 00:23:37.308
Please help!

00:23:37.348 --> 00:23:38.228
Over there.

00:23:38.388 --> 00:23:39.364
- Sh*t!
- Help!

00:23:39.988 --> 00:23:40.750
Bro!

00:24:05.188 --> 00:24:06.048
Hang on.

00:24:06.408 --> 00:24:07.188
He's injured.

00:24:09.668 --> 00:24:10.388
Mind...

00:24:10.788 --> 00:24:11.348
Yes?

00:24:11.388 --> 00:24:12.588
We've found the missing person.

00:24:12.708 --> 00:24:14.508
We need more medical supplies.

00:24:15.108 --> 00:24:17.448
Head south from the scene, ten minutes out.

00:24:17.708 --> 00:24:18.613
Roger that.

00:24:19.448 --> 00:24:20.828
We've found the missing!

00:24:20.868 --> 00:24:21.668
Let's go!

00:24:22.828 --> 00:24:24.948
Then don't move this body yet

00:24:24.988 --> 00:24:26.228
until all the rangers get here.

00:24:26.628 --> 00:24:27.828
- Yes, sir.
- We'll go help the rest.

00:24:46.268 --> 00:24:47.348
Help!

00:24:49.028 --> 00:24:49.748
Help me!

00:24:56.296 --> 00:25:00.817
♫No matter how long it takes♫

00:25:00.857 --> 00:25:03.296
♫I'll still choose to love you♫

00:25:27.376 --> 00:25:28.976
They told us to come here,

00:25:29.216 --> 00:25:30.616
but where are they?

00:25:37.096 --> 00:25:37.995
That's a person!

00:26:00.296 --> 00:26:05.616
(Casting a spell)

00:26:07.976 --> 00:26:13.341
(Casting a spell)

00:26:21.456 --> 00:26:24.176
May Kalakal's body and atman
be bound and sealed,

00:26:24.216 --> 00:26:27.736
never to be reborn
to bring decay upon the people

00:26:27.896 --> 00:26:28.896
from this moment forth!

00:26:52.056 --> 00:26:53.176
Yeah, right there.

00:26:53.796 --> 00:26:54.605
Got it.

00:26:58.856 --> 00:27:00.736
The other rangers have reached the body,

00:27:00.976 --> 00:27:03.336
and your rescue team is on their way.

00:27:10.256 --> 00:27:11.176
What's wrong?

00:27:12.616 --> 00:27:13.536
I'm not sure,

00:27:14.336 --> 00:27:15.336
but I have a bad feeling

00:27:16.216 --> 00:27:17.216
something might go wrong.

00:27:22.036 --> 00:27:24.256
I've been waiting a thousand years
for this day,

00:27:25.036 --> 00:27:26.536
the day you would return.

00:27:27.656 --> 00:27:28.576
Suriya,

00:27:29.096 --> 00:27:30.296
set me free!

00:27:55.496 --> 00:27:56.216
- Ugh...
- Ugh!

00:27:56.376 --> 00:27:57.016
Mr. Siwat!

00:27:57.056 --> 00:27:58.056
Hey, let go of me!

00:27:58.096 --> 00:27:58.896
- Hey!
- Mr. Siwat!

00:28:07.256 --> 00:28:08.056
Mr. Siwat...

00:28:22.456 --> 00:28:23.336
Hey!

00:28:25.576 --> 00:28:26.776
What's wrong with you?!

00:28:27.056 --> 00:28:27.896
Let go of me!

00:28:28.116 --> 00:28:29.256
Let go of me, Mr. Siwat!

00:28:31.336 --> 00:28:32.134
Hey!

00:28:32.456 --> 00:28:33.896
Hey, let go of her.

00:28:34.136 --> 00:28:34.776
Please...

00:28:38.656 --> 00:28:39.456
Mr. Siwat!

00:28:43.656 --> 00:28:44.536
Hey...

00:28:44.576 --> 00:28:45.736
Please...

00:28:46.096 --> 00:28:47.016
Let go!

00:28:47.056 --> 00:28:47.696
Hey!

00:28:53.096 --> 00:28:53.856
Let go!

00:28:54.996 --> 00:28:55.816
Lookwaii,

00:28:55.856 --> 00:28:57.376
I need help!

00:28:58.456 --> 00:28:59.296
- Lookwaii!
- Mind?

00:28:59.336 --> 00:29:00.896
- Help me!
- What's going on?

00:29:01.736 --> 00:29:02.576
Mind!

00:29:16.056 --> 00:29:16.936
She's not answering.

00:29:17.996 --> 00:29:19.176
You can go check on them.

00:29:19.216 --> 00:29:20.296
Leave this one to me.

00:29:22.736 --> 00:29:23.616
Come on, guys.

00:29:23.976 --> 00:29:25.376
- Hurry.
- Let's go.

00:29:27.216 --> 00:29:28.176
Help!

00:29:29.456 --> 00:29:30.376
Help me!

00:29:32.256 --> 00:29:32.878
Help...

00:29:39.056 --> 00:29:39.776
- Siwat!
- Help!

00:29:46.016 --> 00:29:46.816
It's me.

00:29:47.136 --> 00:29:47.856
It's me.

00:29:51.336 --> 00:29:52.136
- Siwat.
- Help me!

00:30:05.256 --> 00:30:06.696
Suriya is mine.

00:30:08.536 --> 00:30:10.696
He loves me, not you.

00:30:44.896 --> 00:30:45.616
Hey!

00:30:48.296 --> 00:30:49.096
Sh*t!

00:31:46.256 --> 00:31:47.336
Siwat, come back!

00:31:50.776 --> 00:31:51.696
Get a grip!

00:32:14.696 --> 00:32:15.576
Suriya,

00:32:15.616 --> 00:32:17.616
you need to choose between me and Asuni.

00:33:03.016 --> 00:33:03.936
Khunkhao!

00:33:06.576 --> 00:33:07.576
You're back.

00:33:16.016 --> 00:33:17.216
Thank you.

00:33:34.376 --> 00:33:35.536
Everything's okay now.

00:33:39.296 --> 00:33:41.096
Siwat was so scary.

00:33:41.376 --> 00:33:42.476
Does it hurt badly?

00:33:46.456 --> 00:33:47.696
Let me address your wound.

00:34:09.696 --> 00:34:10.896
You're safe now.

00:34:11.656 --> 00:34:15.096

00:35:22.976 --> 00:35:25.576
Kalakal was also one of the Benders.

00:35:27.096 --> 00:35:29.256
Why would we have to bind him anyway?

00:35:32.496 --> 00:35:34.496
How could we have turned
into his enemies?

00:35:39.736 --> 00:35:41.016
But one thing's certain.

00:35:41.416 --> 00:35:42.896
I've finally found the reason

00:35:43.256 --> 00:35:45.976
why I felt a bond with you
when we first met.

00:35:47.816 --> 00:35:50.016
I've found the answer
I've been searching for.

00:35:52.216 --> 00:35:54.216
Anyway, what do we do with this thing?

00:36:56.216 --> 00:36:57.416
We'll bury it here.

00:37:00.016 --> 00:37:01.216
Do you see what I see, Professor?

00:37:02.884 --> 00:37:07.404
♫No matter how long it takes♫

00:37:07.444 --> 00:37:09.644

We'll bury it here.

00:37:29.444 --> 00:37:31.484
But it'll be found someday anyway.

00:37:32.764 --> 00:37:33.764
Leave it to me.

00:38:31.404 --> 00:38:32.644
Begone!

00:38:46.544 --> 00:38:47.474
That...

00:38:49.164 --> 00:38:50.724
Do you see what I see, Professor?

00:39:14.144 --> 00:39:15.044
Let's go, Kor.

00:39:27.484 --> 00:39:28.564
- Mind, I...
- Oh...

00:39:29.164 --> 00:39:30.404
Let's get something to eat.

00:39:39.164 --> 00:39:40.164
Don't worry about it.

00:39:46.564 --> 00:39:48.724
Can't blame her for being scared of me.

00:40:06.364 --> 00:40:07.284
This one has cats.

00:40:10.044 --> 00:40:11.164
This one's a dog.

00:40:15.964 --> 00:40:16.964
I'll take this, too.

00:40:17.124 --> 00:40:17.844
Sure.

00:40:20.284 --> 00:40:21.564
What are those, Pun?

00:40:22.684 --> 00:40:23.564
What?

00:40:24.084 --> 00:40:25.404
OTOP bags, you know.

00:40:25.764 --> 00:40:26.764
A dog and cats.

00:40:27.044 --> 00:40:28.044
They're cute, right?

00:40:29.564 --> 00:40:30.964
Cute, huh?

00:40:31.004 --> 00:40:32.004
A**hole.

00:40:42.804 --> 00:40:44.844
You've got over 200 M-Stamps.

00:40:44.884 --> 00:40:47.204
Would you like to redeem them
to get this premium collection?

00:40:47.444 --> 00:40:50.044
You can choose
between Hello Kitty and Butterbear.

00:40:50.084 --> 00:40:51.764
Which one would you like?

00:40:52.844 --> 00:40:53.844
The pink one, please.

00:40:53.957 --> 00:40:54.957
Alright.

00:40:55.004 --> 00:40:55.924
What the hell?

00:40:55.964 --> 00:40:57.884
You'll be taking the Hello Kitty tote.

00:40:58.124 --> 00:41:01.724
You need 99 M-Stamps and one baht
to redeem this tote.

00:41:01.764 --> 00:41:03.164
Show me your code, please.

00:41:03.324 --> 00:41:04.124
Here you go.

00:41:05.124 --> 00:41:07.204
- It's so cute!
- And one baht, please.

00:41:07.237 --> 00:41:08.357
Give her the freaking one baht.

00:41:11.284 --> 00:41:12.284
- Here you go.
- Alright.

00:41:13.684 --> 00:41:16.444
- It's all done. Here, sir.
- I'll use it now.

00:41:18.324 --> 00:41:20.124
Aw, gosh...

00:41:25.124 --> 00:41:26.484
I couldn't help but scream!

00:41:27.444 --> 00:41:29.044
Look at that adorable pink.

00:41:30.844 --> 00:41:31.764
Mind,

00:41:32.204 --> 00:41:33.204
which one would you like?

00:41:35.104 --> 00:41:35.884
This one.

00:42:01.044 --> 00:42:03.324
Are you that scared of him?

00:42:03.364 --> 00:42:05.124
He's thrown off now.

00:42:07.764 --> 00:42:09.164
Well, you didn't see it.

00:42:09.524 --> 00:42:11.244
You didn't see how terrifying he was.

00:42:13.244 --> 00:42:16.324
The flames suddenly appeared in his hands,

00:42:17.444 --> 00:42:19.244
and his gaze changed.

00:42:22.644 --> 00:42:23.644
I think...

00:42:24.404 --> 00:42:27.044
he's got to be like Khun and Thara.

00:42:28.064 --> 00:42:29.064
You think so?

00:42:30.244 --> 00:42:31.484
It was really frightening.

00:42:33.204 --> 00:42:34.604
I have no idea what to do now.

00:42:37.084 --> 00:42:38.084
It's nothing.

00:42:38.324 --> 00:42:39.444
Don't worry about it.

00:42:40.164 --> 00:42:41.444
Come on, let's pay.

00:43:01.004 --> 00:43:01.924
Look,

00:43:01.964 --> 00:43:04.764
I've got some OTOP bags.

00:43:06.324 --> 00:43:08.404
Don't stress over things you can't change.

00:43:09.224 --> 00:43:10.442
Everything's gonna be okay.

00:43:14.404 --> 00:43:16.004
Come on, let's go home.

00:43:52.444 --> 00:43:53.444
Aunt Kate,

00:43:54.444 --> 00:43:55.884
there's something you need to know.

00:43:56.544 --> 00:43:57.344
What is it?

00:43:57.724 --> 00:43:58.724
It's Siwat...

00:44:48.604 --> 00:44:50.884
(Casting a spell)

00:44:50.924 --> 00:44:54.124
I now call upon Brahmin Kalakal
to reclaim his body.

00:44:54.324 --> 00:44:55.204
Professor!

00:44:55.724 --> 00:44:57.684
All of our past happened in Tambralinga.

00:44:58.044 --> 00:44:59.604
Once we locate it,

00:44:59.924 --> 00:45:01.465
we'll know how to deal with it.

00:45:01.884 --> 00:45:04.484
I won't let the past
steal away the person I love,

00:45:05.324 --> 00:45:06.324
or you, again.

00:45:08.404 --> 00:45:09.945
Will you forgive my father?

00:45:18.564 --> 00:45:23.004
♫No matter how long it takes♫

00:45:23.044 --> 00:45:26.484
♫I'll still choose to love you♫

00:45:26.524 --> 00:45:33.724

00:45:34.524 --> 00:45:37.964
♫It keeps beating for you forevermore♫

00:45:38.004 --> 00:45:41.564
♫Never want to change, alright♫

00:45:41.604 --> 00:45:46.444
♫There's only you there inside my heart♫

00:45:46.484 --> 00:45:51.124
♫My love for you never evanesces♫
