WEBVTT

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.086
I talked to my mom
for the first time in a while.

00:00:15.653 --> 00:00:19.224
I finally told her I got moved
to Sengoku Weekly's Incident Team.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.659
So then, she told me to quit.

00:00:23.461 --> 00:00:25.363
But you wouldn't quit, right?

00:00:27.165 --> 00:00:31.469
I had a hard time keeping up
with all the work I was tasked to do,

00:00:31.536 --> 00:00:33.104
so I briefly considered it.

00:00:33.905 --> 00:00:35.740
That's how it is at first.

00:00:36.908 --> 00:00:39.577
What do I need to do
to get to do my own work?

00:00:40.712 --> 00:00:44.149
That reminds me,
when you were at your old department,

00:00:44.215 --> 00:00:47.051
weren't you excited
when you got an interview in?

00:00:48.186 --> 00:00:50.388
It was the first feature I got to lead.

00:00:51.322 --> 00:00:54.425
Why don't you set up an interview
for the Sengoku Weekly?

00:00:56.294 --> 00:00:57.795
I never considered that.

00:00:59.531 --> 00:01:00.932
You're right…

00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:06.237
An interview for the Sengoku Weekly.

00:01:09.974 --> 00:01:11.109
Sounds good.

00:01:11.176 --> 00:01:13.111
Maybe write up a few general questions.

00:01:13.711 --> 00:01:16.381
Sometimes a big name will accept
for some reason.

00:01:17.081 --> 00:01:18.249
I will!

00:01:18.316 --> 00:01:20.552
I have experience
with interview questions.

00:01:21.419 --> 00:01:23.154
But it can't be just anyone.

00:01:24.422 --> 00:01:27.158
I mean, you'll have to use
your own judgment,

00:01:27.225 --> 00:01:29.127
even if someone agrees to it,

00:01:29.794 --> 00:01:32.430
it'll get scrapped if the Desk
isn't interested.

00:01:32.497 --> 00:01:33.731
Then you're screwed.

00:01:33.798 --> 00:01:34.699
Why?

00:01:34.766 --> 00:01:38.269
You won't hear the end of it
at the pitch meeting.

00:01:38.336 --> 00:01:40.205
He'll call it tiny or tepid.

00:01:40.271 --> 00:01:41.773
-Or "It's bland."
-Or "Rejected!"

00:01:41.839 --> 00:01:44.976
-Or "You think this is good?"
-"Worth less than toilet paper."

00:01:45.043 --> 00:01:47.078
I'll try to find someone good then.

00:01:48.346 --> 00:01:49.814
WRITE SOME QUESTIONS

00:01:52.183 --> 00:01:53.017
Sorry.

00:01:54.018 --> 00:01:54.953
Good luck.

00:01:55.954 --> 00:01:56.788
Yes?

00:01:59.257 --> 00:02:01.359
This might be pretty tough.

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.440
HIMAWARI MINATO
DAIGO IWAKURA

00:02:17.475 --> 00:02:22.180
The only people I actually want to meet
tend to be decent people.

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:29.854
But I know that makes for a weak
interview for the Sengoku Weekly.

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:32.590
Come in.

00:02:33.391 --> 00:02:34.592
You wanted to see me?

00:02:36.027 --> 00:02:37.295
Oh, it smells good.

00:02:37.362 --> 00:02:38.529
Have you had lunch?

00:02:38.596 --> 00:02:39.497
Not yet.

00:02:40.098 --> 00:02:41.399
You can have all this.

00:02:42.233 --> 00:02:43.134
Really?

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:49.274
Is this an experiment?

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.208
Not at all.

00:02:50.842 --> 00:02:52.744
I have a favor to ask you.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.145
Help me while you eat?

00:03:05.056 --> 00:03:06.057
I see.

00:03:06.557 --> 00:03:08.092
That is a tough one.

00:03:09.861 --> 00:03:11.896
I managed to come up with five people.

00:03:11.963 --> 00:03:13.331
Let me run through them.

00:03:13.398 --> 00:03:14.299
Okay.

00:03:16.567 --> 00:03:21.272
A second-generation councilperson
who is not meshing with her supporters.

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.742
It's a little too niche to be interesting.

00:03:25.376 --> 00:03:26.511
Next please.

00:03:29.113 --> 00:03:31.883
A department store manager
being accused of harassment.

00:03:32.684 --> 00:03:35.520
I don't need an interview
to get the picture.

00:03:35.586 --> 00:03:36.454
Next.

00:03:39.257 --> 00:03:42.226
An insider from a movie
with a suddenly replaced lead actor.

00:03:42.293 --> 00:03:43.761
That's a common occurrence.

00:03:43.828 --> 00:03:46.831
In this case, you'd need to
interview more than one person.

00:03:46.898 --> 00:03:48.666
And the actor in question is important.

00:03:53.971 --> 00:03:57.141
An amateur manga writer
caught evading taxes.

00:03:58.176 --> 00:04:01.879
Being an amateur author instead of
a vetaran could be a good angle,

00:04:01.946 --> 00:04:03.748
but I doubt it would work.

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:11.689
An idol singer whose younger sister
became more popular.

00:04:11.756 --> 00:04:14.792
That will just sound like
some sibling quarrel.

00:04:18.096 --> 00:04:19.697
Is that all?

00:04:23.835 --> 00:04:25.169
I don't know.

00:04:27.739 --> 00:04:31.509
You should first research
what Kitahama Desk is interested in,

00:04:31.576 --> 00:04:33.344
and base your pick on that.

00:04:33.411 --> 00:04:36.414
Taking a shot in the dark
is just a waste of time.

00:04:36.481 --> 00:04:38.516
If you're tired of playing support,

00:04:38.583 --> 00:04:41.853
you need to fundamentally
change the way you think.

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:42.820
Wait a second.

00:04:43.888 --> 00:04:45.523
That's way too harsh.

00:04:46.858 --> 00:04:50.027
I just channeled Kitahama Desk in my head.

00:04:50.094 --> 00:04:52.897
Maybe wipe the mayo off your face first.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.467
Other side.

00:04:58.202 --> 00:05:01.305
Also, could you not eat
while you criticize me?

00:05:01.372 --> 00:05:03.374
You said I could eat while we do it.

00:05:06.944 --> 00:05:07.912
Come in.

00:05:09.414 --> 00:05:10.281
There you are.

00:05:10.348 --> 00:05:11.582
-Good work.
-Hey.

00:05:11.649 --> 00:05:12.383
It stinks.

00:05:13.684 --> 00:05:15.453
-Is now a good time?
-Sure.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.256
You did an interview feature
at your old post,

00:05:18.322 --> 00:05:20.024
with the actor Kosuke Suenaga.

00:05:20.091 --> 00:05:22.360
Yes, I did. About him leaving his troupe.

00:05:22.427 --> 00:05:25.263
Apparently he suddenly
pulled out of a play.

00:05:26.397 --> 00:05:27.265
Huh?

00:05:28.966 --> 00:05:33.404
There were rumors of various forms
of harassment and mental instability,

00:05:33.471 --> 00:05:36.641
he must have caused another scandal
to get forced out.

00:05:36.707 --> 00:05:38.443
Can you find out what happened?

00:05:39.777 --> 00:05:41.145
His reason for leaving the play?

00:05:44.482 --> 00:05:46.651
Yes, understood.

00:05:46.717 --> 00:05:48.386
Looking forward to it.

00:05:48.453 --> 00:05:49.287
Goodbye.

00:05:49.353 --> 00:05:51.656
ONE YEAR AGO
AT THE PR ZINE DEPARTMENT

00:05:53.057 --> 00:05:54.692
Perfect. Thank you.

00:05:55.226 --> 00:05:57.728
Sorry, Nayumi,
Mr. Suenaga is running late.

00:05:57.795 --> 00:05:59.530
Do you mind waiting?

00:05:59.597 --> 00:06:01.199
-Okay.
-My apologies.

00:06:01.265 --> 00:06:02.667
-Actually.
-Yes?

00:06:02.733 --> 00:06:07.605
I heard Mr. Suenaga was mentally unstable.

00:06:08.372 --> 00:06:09.807
They're just rumors.

00:06:09.874 --> 00:06:11.843
That he takes medication for it.

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:14.111
We don't know if that's true or not.

00:06:14.178 --> 00:06:15.713
It'll be fine.

00:06:20.585 --> 00:06:22.253
I'll go get Mr. Suenaga.

00:06:38.903 --> 00:06:40.004
Ms. Shinoda.

00:06:40.071 --> 00:06:42.373
We found Suenaga's usual hair salon.

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.742
His stylist is named Miyoshi. Can you go?

00:06:45.376 --> 00:06:46.277
Okay.

00:06:46.344 --> 00:06:47.445
It'll be compensated.

00:06:48.212 --> 00:06:51.949
Huh? Wait, do you mean
I should get my hair cut?

00:06:56.988 --> 00:06:59.023
We're having trouble getting info.

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:02.426
We go to rehearsals, but no one
involved with the play will talk.

00:07:02.493 --> 00:07:04.962
He won't even respond
if we do a house visit.

00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:08.432
We go to his favorite pub Tokichiro,
and it's always packed.

00:07:08.499 --> 00:07:11.702
The hair salon should be easier
in that regard. Good luck.

00:07:11.769 --> 00:07:13.204
We're ready for you now.

00:07:13.271 --> 00:07:14.138
Okay.

00:07:21.445 --> 00:07:23.214
SENGOKU WEEKLY

00:07:35.059 --> 00:07:36.627
Sorry for the wait.

00:07:38.596 --> 00:07:41.566
Thank you for requesting me,
how do you want it cut?

00:07:42.934 --> 00:07:45.102
I'd like to thin it out a bit.

00:07:45.169 --> 00:07:46.404
Understood.

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:47.872
We'll start with a wash.

00:07:50.007 --> 00:07:51.309
Excuse me.

00:07:57.248 --> 00:07:59.216
It's still so hot these days.

00:08:05.523 --> 00:08:06.357
Um.

00:08:07.825 --> 00:08:10.661
Does Kosuke Suenaga come here often?

00:08:22.373 --> 00:08:24.875
We've had several people like you come in.

00:08:35.486 --> 00:08:36.520
A tabloid, huh?

00:08:41.359 --> 00:08:42.860
Aren't you embarrassed?

00:08:43.828 --> 00:08:48.199
Buzzing around human misery.
Only ever exposing their bad side.

00:08:49.767 --> 00:08:51.636
Digging up just the surface,

00:08:52.536 --> 00:08:54.972
spreading it to entertain the masses.

00:08:56.641 --> 00:08:59.010
You don't even consider
who you might hurt.

00:09:02.713 --> 00:09:03.948
What if it were you?

00:09:06.183 --> 00:09:07.952
What if it was your family?

00:09:10.321 --> 00:09:12.056
Maybe think about that?

00:09:14.625 --> 00:09:16.193
What you're doing

00:09:17.328 --> 00:09:19.563
is stomping on people's lives
and feelings.

00:09:20.631 --> 00:09:21.532
Please leave.

00:09:48.759 --> 00:09:49.593
Hello?

00:09:50.194 --> 00:09:51.162
How'd it go?

00:09:52.797 --> 00:09:54.832
The salon was a bust.

00:09:55.766 --> 00:09:56.934
I see.

00:09:57.668 --> 00:09:58.869
Don't sweat it.

00:10:03.941 --> 00:10:08.279
His favorite pub
is called Tokichiro, right?

00:10:09.847 --> 00:10:11.382
But that place is tricky.

00:10:11.449 --> 00:10:13.050
It's probably full by now.

00:10:13.651 --> 00:10:16.020
I doubt you could question people anyway.

00:10:21.559 --> 00:10:24.962
TOKICHIRO

00:10:35.806 --> 00:10:37.575
Um, excuse me.

00:10:40.444 --> 00:10:42.113
May I talk to you?

00:10:42.747 --> 00:10:45.316
AKARI

00:10:52.423 --> 00:10:54.892
Mr. Suenaga hasn't been visiting
for a while now.

00:10:54.959 --> 00:10:56.994
When did he stop coming?

00:10:58.395 --> 00:11:00.631
I can't talk about our patrons.

00:11:00.698 --> 00:11:02.299
That's understandable.

00:11:03.434 --> 00:11:05.603
But he was causing lots of problems.

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:09.840
Even when it was super crowded
he'd talk to me when I served him.

00:11:10.875 --> 00:11:13.010
I ignored him once, and he got super sad.

00:11:13.077 --> 00:11:14.945
Was that the last time he came?

00:11:16.814 --> 00:11:17.648
No, it wasn't.

00:11:17.715 --> 00:11:19.517
With the same girl as usual.

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:24.955
-You want to know who the girl was, right?
-Sure.

00:11:26.223 --> 00:11:29.093
But I won't tell you because
I want to protect her.

00:11:29.693 --> 00:11:31.462
So it's a celebrity, right?

00:11:33.397 --> 00:11:35.032
-I'm not telling you.
-It's okay.

00:11:35.966 --> 00:11:41.005
Could you tell me any interesting
stories about Mr. Suenaga then?

00:11:41.839 --> 00:11:43.941
Huh? That's all you want?

00:11:44.008 --> 00:11:44.942
Of course.

00:11:45.009 --> 00:11:46.744
You can just share what you can.

00:11:47.878 --> 00:11:49.346
Interesting stories?

00:11:50.881 --> 00:11:54.185
There was nothing interesting
about Mr. Suenaga.

00:11:56.387 --> 00:11:57.788
It was around last year.

00:11:58.355 --> 00:12:00.291
He apparently stopped drinking,

00:12:00.357 --> 00:12:03.093
and only ordered alcohol-free beer.

00:12:03.894 --> 00:12:08.399
But he'd always ask for a chaser
even though it's non-alcoholic.

00:12:08.465 --> 00:12:10.267
And we'd all laugh at the joke.

00:12:12.102 --> 00:12:13.237
Does that mean, water?

00:12:13.304 --> 00:12:14.338
Yeah.

00:12:14.405 --> 00:12:17.708
The girl cracked a joke about him
getting water with his alcohol-free beer.

00:12:17.775 --> 00:12:19.343
They seemed happy.

00:12:24.248 --> 00:12:28.619
We got a text chain from someone
who's calling herself "Mistress Three."

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:32.623
It's really great, just take a look!

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:34.124
You love this stuff!

00:12:34.191 --> 00:12:36.160
Nothing scarier than a mistress story.

00:12:36.227 --> 00:12:38.128
Kitahama loves mistresses.

00:12:38.195 --> 00:12:40.497
Plus, they keep talking dirty.

00:12:41.565 --> 00:12:43.500
When was the most recent message?

00:12:44.301 --> 00:12:45.169
Six months ago.

00:12:45.236 --> 00:12:47.738
"Let's end this. I'm sorry."

00:12:49.006 --> 00:12:50.140
That's scary.

00:12:50.207 --> 00:12:51.108
Right?

00:12:51.175 --> 00:12:53.410
He promised to marry Mistress Three,

00:12:53.477 --> 00:12:55.179
but then he dumps her.

00:12:55.246 --> 00:12:57.381
He won't even answer his phone.

00:12:57.882 --> 00:13:00.751
So she left a terrifying message
on his voice mail.

00:13:01.385 --> 00:13:05.422
"I'll send all our texts to a tabloid."

00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:08.225
So, he stepped down
before this came to light.

00:13:08.292 --> 00:13:10.961
Exactly! Now, turn it into an article.

00:13:11.028 --> 00:13:12.563
Give it a big headline!

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:13.364
Okay.

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:15.232
Could I say something?

00:13:17.167 --> 00:13:19.470
Something's been on my mind.

00:13:22.773 --> 00:13:24.775
I read the latest Sengoku Weekly.

00:13:25.709 --> 00:13:29.380
Only a small number of his fans
would defend Suenaga's scandal.

00:13:29.446 --> 00:13:30.948
THE TRUTH BEHIND
KOSUKE SUENAGA'S DEPARTURE

00:13:31.015 --> 00:13:35.619
There are a lot of online comments saying
he stepped down because of this story.

00:13:37.321 --> 00:13:40.224
Everybody loves juicy
entertainment industry gossip.

00:13:40.291 --> 00:13:42.726
It's also a popular subject for novels.

00:13:44.128 --> 00:13:47.131
Which is why when authors
write about the entertainment industry,

00:13:47.197 --> 00:13:49.667
they do as much research as a tabloid,

00:13:49.733 --> 00:13:51.402
and even wear themselves down.

00:13:53.137 --> 00:13:55.139
It's hard everywhere.

00:13:57.274 --> 00:13:59.109
I definitely believe that.

00:14:03.113 --> 00:14:04.415
You can't send that.

00:14:04.481 --> 00:14:06.317
The theater folks are objecting.

00:14:07.051 --> 00:14:10.754
It's not 90 percent of theater company
reps dating their lead actresses.

00:14:10.821 --> 00:14:11.989
It's 80 percent.

00:14:13.157 --> 00:14:16.560
For the follow-up,
we'll go with Mistress Three's identity.

00:14:16.627 --> 00:14:20.497
Mr. Kitahama, our articles from this week
are doing well online.

00:14:22.099 --> 00:14:23.233
Really nice!

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:27.237
So Mistress Three's picture,
should we go with modest or sexy?

00:14:27.304 --> 00:14:29.406
-Sexy!
-Which is the right call?

00:14:29.473 --> 00:14:30.841
-Mr. Kitahama.
-What?

00:14:32.109 --> 00:14:34.645
[BREAKING] STAGE ACTOR
KOSUKE SUENAGA PASSED AWAY

00:14:40.217 --> 00:14:41.752
According to an insider,

00:14:41.819 --> 00:14:47.191
Suenaga hoped to finish his last play
while battling terminal cancer,

00:14:47.257 --> 00:14:49.893
but he stepped down
after his condition got worse.

00:14:56.333 --> 00:14:59.236
Honestly, it's not surprising
we got backlash.

00:14:59.303 --> 00:15:02.606
But it's less than I expected.

00:15:04.074 --> 00:15:05.409
All thanks to you.

00:15:10.547 --> 00:15:12.716
Something's been on my mind.

00:15:20.924 --> 00:15:22.793
It was during this interview,

00:15:23.494 --> 00:15:26.397
I saw him taking some kind of medication.

00:15:26.997 --> 00:15:29.800
I heard he was mentally unstable,

00:15:29.867 --> 00:15:32.436
so I assumed it was a mood stabilizer.

00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:36.407
But maybe it was a different medication.

00:15:38.075 --> 00:15:40.844
Mr. Suenaga stopped drinking
alcohol last year.

00:15:42.746 --> 00:15:45.582
So you think the medication
is for a disease?

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:49.253
With everyone involved in the play
not talking about it,

00:15:49.319 --> 00:15:52.589
it could be a pretty serious disease.

00:15:53.824 --> 00:15:55.826
It's purely conjecture, though.

00:15:55.893 --> 00:15:57.895
We need more than a hunch.

00:16:00.164 --> 00:16:03.600
Could you check out the surrounding
hospitals just in case?

00:16:03.667 --> 00:16:06.603
I know it'll be hard to get
any personal information, though.

00:16:07.704 --> 00:16:14.078
Daisuke, let's add that story
from the pub to help build credibility.

00:16:14.144 --> 00:16:16.113
And to close the article…

00:16:17.347 --> 00:16:21.218
He had been seen taking medication
last year,

00:16:21.285 --> 00:16:24.822
and learning he quit his favorite vices,
alcohol and cigarettes,

00:16:24.888 --> 00:16:27.658
if the reason he stepped down
is related to his health,

00:16:27.724 --> 00:16:29.226
we pray for his recovery.

00:16:30.894 --> 00:16:32.963
If we only pushed the scandal,

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:35.032
we would've gotten grilled.

00:16:35.099 --> 00:16:37.935
Anyway, it's all thanks to you.

00:16:38.001 --> 00:16:39.369
Please, that's too much.

00:16:40.671 --> 00:16:45.209
But I'm surprised that waitress
shared that he quit alcohol.

00:16:45.843 --> 00:16:50.414
You might have a knack for
bringing down people's defenses.

00:16:51.281 --> 00:16:52.282
For sure.

00:16:52.349 --> 00:16:57.221
That's why Murai had you investigating
his multiple mysterious deaths case.

00:16:57.788 --> 00:16:59.590
Multiple mysterious deaths?

00:17:01.658 --> 00:17:03.894
What, he didn't tell you?

00:17:04.595 --> 00:17:05.496
No.

00:17:07.431 --> 00:17:08.932
MULTIPLE SUSPICIOUS DEATHS

00:17:08.999 --> 00:17:11.101
What? What?!

00:17:11.168 --> 00:17:14.605
I went and verified
Madoka Hashimoto's job.

00:17:14.671 --> 00:17:18.041
And checked the home
of Kubozuka's guardian Mr. Watanabe.

00:17:18.108 --> 00:17:20.477
Your work was crucial.

00:17:21.411 --> 00:17:24.281
I'm sure he'll explain more next time.

00:17:24.848 --> 00:17:25.682
Bye then.

00:17:32.956 --> 00:17:34.925
Multiple mysterious deaths.

00:17:35.959 --> 00:17:40.664
I never imagined I would be involved
in something like this.

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.469
Where am I heading?

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:50.240
What's waiting for me at the end
of this path I've been put on?

00:17:52.676 --> 00:17:53.510
Wait.

00:17:54.111 --> 00:17:56.346
This is no time to be poetic.

00:17:56.947 --> 00:18:01.051
I have to switch gears and work hard
on this interview feature.

00:18:07.291 --> 00:18:09.793
So that's the situation.

00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:10.994
What do you think?

00:18:11.061 --> 00:18:14.064
The name's not ringing any bells.

00:18:14.631 --> 00:18:16.833
You don't know Serendy Shogo?

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:18.669
Never heard of him.

00:18:18.735 --> 00:18:19.903
He's a magician.

00:18:21.838 --> 00:18:24.007
He has lovers all over Japan,

00:18:24.074 --> 00:18:27.544
and he meets with them in hotels
when he visits other cities,

00:18:28.512 --> 00:18:30.647
according to posts from other fans.

00:18:30.714 --> 00:18:32.649
So his audience knows.

00:18:32.716 --> 00:18:37.454
I guess his misdirection only worked
on his magic tricks.

00:18:39.823 --> 00:18:46.196
Anyway, I thought Kitahama Desk might be
interested since he likes love scandals.

00:18:47.998 --> 00:18:49.866
Did you already send questions?

00:18:49.933 --> 00:18:50.801
Not yet.

00:18:50.867 --> 00:18:52.769
Then, before you do,

00:18:52.836 --> 00:18:55.472
I have a request too.

00:18:58.175 --> 00:19:00.010
Mr. Aoshiro?

00:19:00.077 --> 00:19:00.911
You know him?

00:19:00.978 --> 00:19:04.348
Yes, I've seen him on TV
and in newspapers.

00:19:05.082 --> 00:19:06.316
He's known for his looks.

00:19:06.383 --> 00:19:07.551
Right.

00:19:08.118 --> 00:19:12.556
He inherited a small apparel company
in Niigata from his parents,

00:19:12.623 --> 00:19:15.726
and made it into a national brand
within a few years.

00:19:15.792 --> 00:19:17.060
A young man's success story.

00:19:17.127 --> 00:19:19.229
He's really impressive.

00:19:19.296 --> 00:19:21.898
It's good you've already heard of him.

00:19:21.965 --> 00:19:24.001
-You should request an interview.
-What?!

00:19:24.067 --> 00:19:26.136
With Mr. Aoshiro? Oh crap!

00:19:26.203 --> 00:19:27.070
Nosebleed?

00:19:27.137 --> 00:19:28.372
No, just snot.

00:19:28.438 --> 00:19:29.673
You surprised me.

00:19:30.307 --> 00:19:31.308
Sorry.

00:19:32.175 --> 00:19:33.644
It'd be cool if it happens.

00:19:36.013 --> 00:19:37.014
So?

00:19:39.182 --> 00:19:41.652
An interview with Seiya Aoshiro.

00:19:47.357 --> 00:19:48.959
TO BE CONTINUED

00:19:49.026 --> 00:19:51.995
This isn't what we talked about!

00:19:52.062 --> 00:19:53.297
I might be in trouble.

00:19:53.363 --> 00:19:56.099
Those two only smile
if they're up to something.

00:19:56.166 --> 00:19:59.603
It's not a coincidence.
How did I not notice until now?

00:20:00.771 --> 00:20:02.639
It's starting to get interesting.

00:20:03.373 --> 00:20:04.941
