WEBVTT

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.880
You can kick me out if you want.

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.200
Why would I?

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.640
If it weren’t for me,

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.600
you wouldn’t have to deal with this crap.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.280
It's not your fault.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.160
The one who wrote on the wall is the one at fault.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.560
Put the hat on.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:16.960
You know what happens

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.400
when you mess with Professor Mint.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.160
Just let me graduate quietly, please.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.320
I think we need proof.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.200
Sorry I was never able to help you.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.920
Sorry too, Saint.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.240
When you sober up,

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.560
I’ll tell you the whole truth.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.039
(Ice)

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:29.039
Hello, you’re awake?

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.480
Yeah…

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.200
thank you.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.640
You must’ve taken care of me last night, right?

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.280
But, uh… you didn’t have to change my clothes

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.000
or underwear, you know.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:41.320
Hmm?

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.160
Change what?

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.360
Saint was the one who took you

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.000
back to your room last night.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.360
Saint?

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.560
Then…

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.240
Saint saw my dick?!

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.600
Well, you were drunk out of your mind,

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.920
acting wild and refusing to go back to your room.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.440
Did I cause a scene last night or did I cry?

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.040
Did I do anything embarrassing or kiss anyone?

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.040
Oh god, let’s just say

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.079
the video clip could tell it better than I can.

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:19.000
And don’t forget to thank Saint.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.000
Ice, stop moving already!

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.680
No.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.160
Come on, let’s go back.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.360
You’re hugging the pole like a damn panda!

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.680
Ice, let’s go home, okay?

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.480
If you don’t let go,

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.400
I’ll bite you!

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.600
Hey!

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.760
Ow!

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.720
What the hell, Ice?!

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.440
I’m not Ice,

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.440
I’m a panda!

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.440
You’ve been bitten! You’re dead for sure!

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.640
Let’s go!

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.160
Shit!

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:42.880
Morning.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:44.640
What?

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.200
Nothing.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.040
Hey.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.280
Let’s clear something up.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.600
Why did my clothes change?

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.480
Did you take advantage of me?

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:00.640
What?

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.000
No.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.640
You’re the one who took everything off.

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.160
I said I’d wait outside,

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.280
but you wouldn’t listen.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:09.720
You kept saying,

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.520
Saint, take it off for me.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:14.880
Something like, take it off

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:15.960
and something about hugs.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.840
I don’t believe you.

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.080
Wanna see the video?

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:20.400
You have one?

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.160
No.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.440
But Meena might.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.920
You started undressing

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.120
before we even got in the elevator.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.480
If you don’t believe me, check the CCTV.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:30.760
Oh…

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.159
Did anyone else see?

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.720
Just me.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.640
Good thing I got you inside in time.

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.120
Otherwise, it would’ve gone viral for sure.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.640
Why did I have to be the one

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.520
who saw your dick when you’re drunk?

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.600
If I wasn’t drunk, you wouldn’t have seen it!

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.200
And what happened to your hand?

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.480
Hot porridge burn?

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.160
Yeah, hot porridge burn.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.760
Burned so bad I should probably get a rabies shot!

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:18.760
Serves you right.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.880
That’s what you get for messing with me.

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.680
If you wanna move out, now’s your chance

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.480
before the landlord charges us for the paint.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:30.680
What paint?

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.520
The..

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.159
paint on the door.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.360
You could have just left it.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:00.760
I would have scrubed it off.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
I don’t want people saying that

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.240
all I did was watch you get bullied.

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.240
Anyway, about the guy who did it,

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.880
Meena’s already checking the CCTV footage.

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:15.800
We’ll probably know who it was by today.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.080
Hey, don’t cross the line.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:25.680
Step back.

00:07:33.159 --> 00:07:34.480
Here, breakfast.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.720
Saint,

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:45.280
give it!

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.400
That’s it?

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:58.560
Yeah.

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:01.920
That’s it?

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.000
Yeah.

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:08.720
Is it spoiled?

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.520
Welcome, Saint and Ice,

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.760
to the first Midnight Sun Workshop!

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:22.760
Woohoo!

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:24.040
Yay!

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.120
Happy faces, come on!

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.640
Okay,

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.400
today we’re jumping right into scene work.

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.560
Remember the scene you auditioned with?

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.280
Yes. Yes.

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:36.000
Let’s see what you’ve got for us.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.320
If you're ready,

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:38.760
let's start.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:41.919
Three.

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:42.960
Two.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.560
One.

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:45.480
Action!

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.480
What are you doing?

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:51.200
Nothing.

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:54.160
Give it here.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.560
Hey, don’t!

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:58.080
Let go!

00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:58.640
Hey,

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.000
Don’t!

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:01.720
Get out!

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:02.360
Don’t!

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:04.840
Let go!

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:11.240
You might need to hold me tighter than that.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.440
Let’s go again.

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:15.000
Three.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.240
Two.

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:17.600
One.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:18.640
Action!

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:23.680
What are you doing?

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:25.400
Nothing.

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:29.520
Give it to me.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.520
Hey, let go!

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.320
Let go!

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:34.440
You like me, don’t you?

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:41.360
Uh…

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:45.000
aren’t you supposed to say that after the mom leaves?

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:48.200
Okay,

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:50.480
stop for a sec.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:51.840
I don’t think that worked.

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:54.320
Let’s talk.

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:58.960
What’s your take on the scene?

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:02.840
I’m still confused.

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.520
What kind of character is this?

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:07.280
Has he ever even been mad at anyone before?

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:08.840
He’s way too soft.

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:09.720
If it were me,

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:12.400
I’d hit back hard.

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:16.640
Did you mean to make him so weak?

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:19.000
What do you think, Saint?

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:28.360
I don’t think it’s strange

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.640
that he's not angry.

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:32.800
Why?

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:40.240
Because he’s probably angriest

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.120
at himself for being helpless.

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:47.440
He’s poor, can’t make money,

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.720
his dad’s sick,

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.200
and he can’t do anything to help.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.240
He just keeps living day by day,

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.840
watching everything fall apart.

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:00.840
And his dad?

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:03.520
Is he still a father at that point?

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:06.240
After everything he’s done,

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:08.240
why does Seen still forgive him?

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:11.880
He just loves his dad, that’s all.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:12.880
Love?

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:15.560
More like being a coward.

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:22.520
No, he just craves warmth.

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:26.960
Seen wants a loving family.

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:31.120
He believes one day his dad will change

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:34.000
from a bad person to someone better.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
That he’ll understand him

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.720
and love him again.

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:42.640
And you, Saint?

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:43.560
Any more questions?

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:45.880
Yeah.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:50.280
Why does Kit hurt Seen?

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:54.720
Choking him,

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:57.200
slapping him, talking down to him.

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:01.440
And Seen still loves someone like him?

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.120
What do you think, Ice?

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:07.120
I think Kit’s just confused.

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:08.880
He doesn’t dare to admit

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:10.800
or show how he really feels,

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:14.320
so he pretends he doesn’t care

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:20.000
to make himself seem normal for that time.

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:25.200
By making the person he likes feel bad?

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.480
Yeah, it's set in 1997.

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:34.720
Back then, Thai media still portrayed gay people as bad.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.440
Promiscuous, drug users,

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:40.440
killers and AIDS carriers.

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:43.080
People who were LGBTQ in that era

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:44.400
couldn’t come out.

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:47.760
When the inner and outer conflicts clash,

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:48.600
it leads to...

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:49.760
violent emotions.

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:53.880
Why are you looking at me like that?

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:54.360
Hey.

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:56.800
No reason.

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:02.320
Maybe we should have you two switch roles next time.

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:08.800
But it just doesn’t look right in my head yet.

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:14.720
Let’s rehearse again,

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:17.560
you both still seem awkward.

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:20.000
I’ll direct this time.

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:23.920
I read the script, and…

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:26.800
there are a lot of love scenes.

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:29.520
And some are intense, right?

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:32.600
Yeah.

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:35.880
If you’re uncomfortable,

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:39.120
you don’t have to do anything you don’t want.

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:42.080
But I don’t know if it’s too late to drop out now.

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:43.640
No,

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:44.640
I want to do it.

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:47.760
He wants to!

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:49.440
Oh my~

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:55.640
But...

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.000
I might not be very good at it.

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:03.960
I've...

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:06.840
I've never done it before.

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:07.440
Huh?

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:09.000
Really?

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:10.800
You've never done it?

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:14.520
Wow!

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.800
Everyone! Our lead actor is still a virgin!

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:19.000
Or will this drama be the first step

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.440
that leads Saint into more love scenes?

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:23.840
Will he survive or flop?

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:25.520
Stay tuned.

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:27.760
Say hi~

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.440
Action!

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:38.080
What are you doing?

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:39.640
Nothing.

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.240
Give it here.

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:45.640
Hey,

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:46.920
let go.

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:48.880
Let go!

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:50.440
Let go!

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:51.200
Let go!

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.400
Wait,

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:53.520
this isn’t working

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:56.800
Ice, look at Saint first,

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:58.480
you don’t need to actually go into blocking yet.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000
Saint,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.280
take your shirt off and let Ice smell it now.

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:08.520
Give it to me.

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:11.440
Take it off.

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:15.760
Hurry up.

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:19.120
Make eye contact so we can see their emotions first.

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:21.040
Seen, sniff the shirt

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:23.280
and make it smell like Kit for real.

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:26.040
Hurry up, take it.

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:35.000
Quick.

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:36.760
Three.

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:37.680
Two.

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:38.680
One.

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:40.280
Action!

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.120
What are you doing?

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:53.680
Nothing.

00:15:58.360 --> 00:15:59.360
Give it to me.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:00.840
Hey!

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.080
Let go!

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:04.080
Don’t!

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:05.960
Let go! damn it!

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:08.160
Damn it! Let go!

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:10.840
Kit!

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:12.400
You grab his neck,

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:13.480
force him!

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:16.840
Come on,

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:17.640
squeeze!

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:22.440
Let go!

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:22.960
Ow!

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:26.000
And then ask him something.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.200
Anything, improvise a little.

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:32.120
Kit, what are you feeling, say it out loud.

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:34.800
You like me, don’t you?

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.320
You’re smelling my shirt.

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:37.440
Answer me.

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:38.200
Let go!

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:39.120
Answer me!

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:47.800
Harder!

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:50.520
Answer me!

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:52.240
I told you to let go, damn it!!

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:53.040
Hey!

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:55.200
Saint!

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:55.960
Huh?

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:56.760
Are you ok?

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:58.920
Saint, are you ok?

00:16:58.920 --> 00:16:59.600
I’m fine.

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:00.200
Are you okay?

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:03.320
You okay, right?

00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:08.800
Does it hurt?

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:15.760
I’m sorry.

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:17.640
It’s fine,

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:19.319
you should apologize to Saint.

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:21.760
I’m fine.

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:24.319
I was going a bit hard too.

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:32.960
Honestly.

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:35.280
What the hell is wrong with you guys?

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:38.440
On casting day you two were amazing together.

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:42.320
Now today you can’t even look at each other.

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:44.640
Can you open up and clear this up?

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:47.480
You’re roommates

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:49.040
but you only talk when you’re drunk?

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:54.920
I tried but…

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:00.720
Our schedules don’t line up much,

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:02.720
so we don’t get to talk.

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:04.520
Then message each other.

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:08.480
I can’t,

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:10.680
he blocked my number.

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:15.360
Ugh!

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:17.160
I’m losing it!

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:19.800
If you care about my project at all,

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:21.520
talk to each other, please.

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:23.720
And take out your phone and unblock him right now!

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:26.240
Now!

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:50.840
Geez, what's up with your friends?

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:52.120
Did you tell people about

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:53.560
what happened in the workshop room?

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:54.600
No.

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:55.920
I’ll talk to them.

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:57.160
Don’t.

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:00.000
This time I’ll talk to them.

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:12.760
Sorry!!

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:21.640
The two of us

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:24.000
acknowledge the wrongs we did to you before.

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:27.280
If the Mint situation gets exposed,

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:29.960
there won’t be more victims of Prof. Mint, right?

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:34.000
You know what happens if you mess with him.

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:39.040
We shouldn’t bully

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:42.360
or belittle or shame you for having done porn before.

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:44.840
And we shouldn’t judge you based on what others say.

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:46.040
Or stomp on you,

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:47.960
rub it in when you're down.

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:49.680
Sorry for stealing your songwriting notebook.

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:52.160
And sorry for painting your door.

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:54.640
Even if it was all Mud’s idea alone.

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:55.640
Yeah!

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:56.160
Yeah.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:57.920
Ten!

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:03.360
Okay, anyway, we apologize

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:05.760
for all the shitty stuff we did to you.

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:10.360
And to make it up to you.

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:20.840
I found evidence.

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:22.680
Witnesses!

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:25.160
Ugh..

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:28.360
Come on, tell us what you did to him.

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:34.200
I printed pictures of Ice.

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:36.360
I tossed the paper around on the first day of classes.

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:38.800
The whole thing with

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:40.360
splashing water to mop the floor on Ice,

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:42.360
that was us too.

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:44.280
Anything else?

00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:48.720
Sorry.

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:54.320
Ready?

00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:56.960
Uh.

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:01.560
One.

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:04.240
Two.

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:06.480
Three.

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:08.640
Hey!

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:10.840
What the hell are you doing?

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:12.400
The floor’s a mess now!

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:14.360
The teachers are going to yell for sure!

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:16.640
If you're done then help scrub it all clean.

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:19.280
Shit, I told you we’d get scolded.

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:21.960
But honestly we didn’t want to do it.

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:24.400
Someone hired us to do it.

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:26.440
Don’t make excuses.

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:26.960
Hey.

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:30.560
I want to know who hired you.

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:34.200
I don’t know.

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:37.240
Suddenly 3,000 baht was put in our locker.

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:39.680
And they told us to do as instructed.

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:43.200
And you all did it?

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:44.080
Well, the money was good.

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:46.800
Do it once and get another 3,000.

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:49.800
Yeah, I also got it.

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:52.840
It's not easy to find 6,000 baht in one day!

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:03.080
Ice, I'm really sorry.

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:05.240
I really was wrong.

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:08.360
Yeah, I believe you now.

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:10.200
That you’re truly sorry.

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:11.320
Yes!

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:15.680
Then can I get a hug?

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:17.920
Hey, maybe later.

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:24.920
So from now on,

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:26.480
we’re friends, okay?

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:27.760
Is that fine?

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:34.960
And if there’s ever anything you need help with,

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:36.360
all five of us will help.

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:38.200
We’re willing to do it.

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:40.800
Right, guys?

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:43.080
Right, Ten?

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:44.640
Yeah?

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:45.680
Yeah,

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:46.520
sure.

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:04.640
Damn,

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:07.280
what the hell is this paint, it won’t come off.

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:11.960
Book!

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:14.080
Book, you outside?

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:16.200
Yeah,

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:18.200
where do you want me to go?

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:20.920
Come scrub my back for me.

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:22.520
The paint got on me, I can’t reach.

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:25.640
Then just use a back scrubber.

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:27.680
I don’t have one.

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:32.360
Fine, I’ll go buy one for you.

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:33.440
No.

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:35.280
You come in and scrub for me.

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:37.240
Hurry up, I’ve got plans tonight.

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:44.760
Okay,

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:48.080
but can you at least put on underwear or

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:49.440
a towel first?

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:52.000
Hurry up, damn it, stop stalling. Shit.

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:54.840
What the hell?

00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:57.920
What’s with you?

00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:00.000
Why are you acting shy?

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.120
Alright, you can scrub my back now.

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:24.480
Damn, sometimes I’m just so stupid.

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:27.200
Always doing things without thinking.

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:34.160
Yeah,

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:35.800
I thought you’d be even dumber than this.

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:41.960
I’m glad you believe Ice.

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:44.880
I don’t.

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:47.320
I don’t believe Ice,

00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:50.000
but I believe you.

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:53.880
You were right about everything.

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:55.760
You’re amazing.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.120
Honestly,

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:02.040
if it weren’t for you,

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:04.040
I don’t know how I’d handle things.

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:07.800
Thanks.

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:12.560
Mm.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.000
Shit!

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:22.880
Turn around, I’m done!

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.320
What’s wrong with you?

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:28.960
Yeah, all done..

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:31.840
Hey, wait.

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:33.560
What.

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:35.600
Let me see.

00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:40.800
Damn, Jymes Alan.

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:42.200
Yeah.

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:43.480
You got tickets?

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:46.160
Someone forwarded them to me.

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:48.320
I don’t really know the person though.

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:50.000
You wanna go?

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:52.760
Sure!

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:56.680
But I don’t have money.

00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:01.880
Take them, it’s fine, my treat.

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:03.480
Damn.

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:06.240
Whoa.

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:12.760
You got two tickets?

00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:16.480
Then...

00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:19.160
can I have both?

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:21.360
I wanna take Cherry.

00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:24.760
She’s a fan of Jymes Alan too.

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:27.160
Perfect,

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:28.720
I’m having dinner with her tonight.

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:36.800
Damn.

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:38.120
Woah.

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:40.680
Shit.

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:46.200
If I manage to win her over,

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:48.360
I’ll be your servant for a month.

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:52.280
Woah!

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:55.160
I’m off then.

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:57.440
Hey, wait,

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:00.840
can you drop it off for me?

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:05.840
Just leave it in front of the TV.

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:06.840
I’m gonna shower.

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:42.160
I think we need a backup plan.

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:43.680
In case these two really can’t work together.

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:45.040
Like, kind really tune into each other.

00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:47.040
We might have to change the cast.

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:48.520
(Lanee)

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.760
Honestly, Sea, just talk.

00:27:58.160 --> 00:27:59.560
I am talking now.

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:02.360
I mean that, sis,

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:03.320
just talk to her.

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:06.120
She’s called several times and you haven’t answered once.

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:09.600
New girlfriend? Or an ex?

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:11.600
Who could it be?

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:12.360
Mm.

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:16.560
Hello, what’s up?

00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:17.920
Where are you?

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:19.120
Studio.

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:22.120
Can you open the door for me?

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:23.240
Oh,

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:25.960
you’re here?

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:27.240
Why didn’t you tell me first?

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:29.520
Who do you think it is?

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:30.680
I think it’s the ex.

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:33.360
You didn't tell me you were coming,

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:34.640
how’d you get here?

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:36.640
I had the driver drop me off.

00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:42.600
Everyone, this is Lanee...

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:47.520
Miss Lanee, daughter of TQB’s chairman,

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:48.680
our sponsor. Hello.

00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:49.480
Hello.

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:54.360
Lanee, this is Cookie, and this is Katie.

00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:55.960
Ah.

00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:58.240
Wow, you’re busy, huh?

00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:00.600
Next time tell me if you're working.

00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:02.600
I’d love to help.

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:05.240
Anything I can do to help?

00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:05.960
No.

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:07.960
Yes.

00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:10.200
Actually, Sea's super stressed right now.

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:12.360
Because our two lead actors

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:14.000
can’t perform properly together.

00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:16.400
Well, it's true.

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:18.080
Saint and Ice?

00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:20.000
What happened?

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.240
I don’t really know, but I recorded it.

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:27.520
Let’s play it.

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:30.240
I hate you.

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:31.320
Just die already.

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:33.240
I told you to let go, damn it.

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:36.720
Is this how you guys workshop scenes?

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:41.760
Did you even do any ice-breaking before that?

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:45.280
Oh, we did! We went for hotpot together once.

00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:46.720
I was actually just thinking..

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:49.480
maybe have them do a sit-up-and-kiss challenge.

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:51.560
Or feed each other tissue with their mouths.

00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:52.640
Or just get them drunk

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:54.640
and let them make out for a whole round.

00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:55.680
Like that!

00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:57.960
I ship them so much! Right?!

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:02.920
That’s exactly the kind of tension you see

00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:05.240
when actors don’t feel safe.

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:08.520
And when they don’t trust each other.

00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:11.640
You didn’t ask for consent first, did you?

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:14.160
I don’t think we need to.

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:17.920
They already know each other from before.

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:20.560
Even if they’ve known each other since high school,

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:24.120
that doesn’t mean they can be scene partners

00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:26.120
without any issues.

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:31.000
Especially when there’s unresolved tension between them.

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:33.400
Wait,

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:36.240
how do you even know all this, Lanee?

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:43.840
I can tell just by watching the clip.

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:47.080
I’ll find a way for them to communicate

00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:49.200
without having to say everything out loud.

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:51.920
Because I doubt they’ll talk openly.

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:54.480
Okay.

00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:56.600
Then

00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:01.360
I’ll teach you how.

00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:12.040
What are you doing?

00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:13.840
Recording

00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:23.160
Both of you stop right there.

00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:27.800
When actors are doing a workshop,

00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:29.800
they need privacy.

00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:34.160
Especially for an erotic scene like this.

00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:36.840
They need a safe space.

00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:40.000
Not everything has to be filmed for content.

00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:42.440
Yes.

00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:07.240
Today’s workshop isn’t difficult at all.

00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:11.440
We just need to hold hands

00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:14.600
and look into each other's eyes.

00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:18.080
And say the first thing that comes to mind.

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:20.720
Anything?

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:21.800
Like,

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:23.560
chair?

00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:27.000
Yeah,

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.280
but actually, it should also involve the other person too.

00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:33.600
The more we focus on our scene partner,

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:36.000
the more the words will feel closer to us.

00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:40.240
When you hear a keyword from the other side,

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:45.000
think about it and see which word pops up.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000
Then just keep the conversation going naturally.

00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:49.320
Does that really help?

00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:54.480
Be honest with your own feelings.

00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:56.520
Try it.

00:32:58.080 --> 00:32:59.080
Okay.

00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:12.280
Brown eyes.

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:14.400
Black eyes.

00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:16.360
Cute nose.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.120
Pink lips.

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:24.480
Be honest with your feelings,

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:25.560
director.

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:28.320
Huh?

00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:32.520
Director Sea.

00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:34.960
Oh,

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:37.320
okay, okay.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:42.800
Talented.

00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:46.680
Not sure.

00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:48.360
Talented.

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:50.680
Thank you.

00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:54.440
Beautiful.

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:57.320
I know.

00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:01.840
Ex.

00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:03.880
Different.

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:06.480
Afraid.

00:34:08.239 --> 00:34:09.199
Honest.

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:11.600
Not sure.

00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:14.920
Promise.

00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:20.760
I promise I won’t make you sad

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:21.840
or overthink

00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:23.880
like your ex did.

00:34:27.719 --> 00:34:29.040
Thank you.

00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:48.360
Okay.

00:34:48.719 --> 00:34:51.080
That’s basically what this workshop is like.

00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:55.520
Actually, there were some words that weren’t keywords,

00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:57.120
but that’s fine.

00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:59.960
Now that both of us feel

00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:02.600
more confident and trust each other more,

00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:04.800
try doing some body contact.

00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:11.160
Say one word that you feel the most right now.

00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:18.840
I like you.

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:21.440
I really like you.

00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:27.840
I like you too.

00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:27.800
Director Sea, are you wearing Jollynn’s brand too?

00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:29.560
You know Jollynn?

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:33.520
Yeah, it’s comfy

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:34.800
and doesn’t have those pressing wires.

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:36.280
That’s true,

00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:39.360
I like it too and can wear it all day.

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:40.600
It’s not tight at all.

00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:43.440
Look.

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:47.960
Comfortable and not constricting.

00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:50.880
Enhances beauty without effort.

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:53.760
You’re basically the model for the ad yourself.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000
So, do you like it?

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.200
It’s beautiful.

00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:23.200
What?

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:26.520
Didn’t you say

00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:30.760
I should understand a character that’s different from me?

00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:34.000
Kit smokes.

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:35.960
So

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:38.960
I want to understand him better.

00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:42.440
You don’t hate it anymore?

00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:46.680
I never hated it,

00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:50.080
did you just assume that?

00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:53.240
Which thing are you talking about?

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.840
Everything, really.

00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:37.920
Why do you look confused?

00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:41.520
Like you weren’t the one who sent it.

00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:43.160
I really didn’t send it.

00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:44.920
Then who the hell typed that?

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:53.840
My dad locked me up back then.

00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:55.600
Huh?

00:40:57.840 --> 00:40:59.360
Why’d your dad lock you up?

00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:05.360
Because of me?

00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:14.520
When I found out about you and Professor Mint,

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.000
I was going to go see you.

00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:21.160
But my dad wouldn’t let me.

00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:23.480
Dad! I was so mad I almost hit him.

00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:25.400
Please don’t do this. He said I was crazy.

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:28.040
He had people lock me up and took my phone.

00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:30.200
Give me my phone back!

00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:31.680
Or I’ll run away from home.

00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:34.640
Watch him carefully. If he doesn’t stop this nonsense,

00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:37.440
lock him up and don’t let him out.

00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:44.520
Since then, my dad’s been watching me all the time.

00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:46.680
So I had to block your number

00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:48.680
and couldn’t contact you again.

00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:54.520
I’ve been waiting all this time

00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:56.520
to see you again.

00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:04.840
I’m really sorry

00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:07.320
I wasn’t there for you.

00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:14.680
About Professor Mint,

00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:18.200
the porn thing,

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000
and the hospital.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:24.440
I’m really sorry.

00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:26.400
But…

00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:33.080
Back then, I really couldn’t do much.

00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:47.800
I’m sorry too.

00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:55.320
You never stopped believing in me.

00:42:57.960 --> 00:42:59.960
But I was the one

00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:03.280
who didn’t believe in you.

00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:14.600
So

00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:18.240
we’re good now, right?

00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:20.880
Yeah.

00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:29.160
Then teach me how to smoke.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:38.000
This one’s a prop cigarette.

00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:44.440
Please, Mr.Tutor?

00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:49.040
Fine.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:05.120
Start by holding it properly.

00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:07.800
Like this.

00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:10.720
No, not like that.

00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:13.080
Oh, you little kid.

00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:15.760
Come here.

00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:20.040
Inhale.

00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:27.560
You little kid.

00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:30.720
Oh please,

00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:33.560
last night you were drunk and crying in my arms.

00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:35.560
How old were you then?

00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:38.840
Give it here.

00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:42.080
Let your tutor show you.

00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:50.600
Exhale first.

00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:56.720
The next lesson is through the nose.

00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:58.320
Like a dragon? Yeah.

00:44:58.320 --> 00:44:59.080
Try it.

00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:01.680
Inhale.

00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:07.680
Hey.

00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:10.920
You get five points.

00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:13.120
Out of a million.

00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:15.200
Yeah.

00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:20.000
Like this?

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:20.840
Hey.

00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:44.600
Hello.

00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:48.240
Ice.

00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:53.240
Before this, I didn’t think it through.

00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:56.240
I just kept pressuring you guys to nail the love scene.

00:45:57.080 --> 00:45:58.560
Instead of letting you two

00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:00.560
understand the characters first.

00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:03.120
To slowly build that connection.

00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:05.440
And when you’re ready,

00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:08.840
then let your own instincts take over.

00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:12.400
I'm sorry.

00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:17.120
I’m sorry for

00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:19.000
making you uncomfortable like that.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.000
I’ll try not to do it again.

00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:23.840
It’s okay.

00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:26.400
Thank you so much, everyone,

00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:27.960
for caring about me.

00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:31.120
And I’m sorry to you too, Saint.

00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:34.040
We forgot to get your consent.

00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:36.400
You probably didn’t feel good

00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:40.280
about being forced to do a love scene.

00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:41.840
It’s alright.

00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:43.280
Thank you for understanding,

00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:46.120
just let me know first next time.

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:53.240
As you know, today we won’t be filming any scenes yet.

00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:55.800
We’ll be doing a workshop about relationship

00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:57.680
and chemistry between you two.

00:46:57.680 --> 00:47:02.040
And today, I’ve invited a special acting coach.

00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:04.080
Please give a big hand to

00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:06.720
the daughter of TQB’s president,

00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:09.280
a former famous child actress

00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:11.440
with over ten years of experience,

00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:15.160
Teacher Lanee.

00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:38.280
If you’re ready,

00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:40.600
open your eyes and look at each other.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.000
When you’re ready, you can start.

00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:00.840
Hair styled.

00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:03.880
Hair down.

00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:06.400
Sharp nose.

00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:10.000
Thin lips.

00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:15.640
Navy shirt.

00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:19.480
Be honest with your feelings.

00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:22.560
Don’t try to look for something else.

00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:26.240
Just say the first thing that comes to your mind.

00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:33.640
Black eyes.

00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:36.720
Beautiful eyes.

00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:43.640
Warm eyes.

00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:47.480
Nice voice.

00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:00.000
Guitar.

00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:11.840
Lamp.

00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:22.200
Sunflower.

00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:29.040
Panda.

00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:47.360
Miss you.

00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:51.520
Miss you.

00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:03.960
Sad.

00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:06.040
Sad too.

00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:26.000
Now, each of you say one sentence that expresses

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:28.000
what you feel most clearly right now.

00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:29.600
Say it.

00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:32.480
I’m sorry.

00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:36.160
I forgive you.

00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:10.720
Thank you, both of you, for being willing to talk.

00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:12.720
And don’t forget to keep practicing

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:14.520
and go over your lines.

00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:17.200
Next time, I’ll go back to rehearse scene eight again.

00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:18.520
Okay.

00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:19.480
Sure thing.

00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:22.000
See you, Sea.

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:23.600
Yeah, get home safe.

00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:41.800
Taxi?

00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:43.720
Uh..

00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:47.400
You can go first.

00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:50.880
I need to go sing at Aor’s bar.

00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:52.320
I can go with you then.

00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:54.080
We can share a cab.

00:51:57.920 --> 00:51:59.920
Alright, sure.

00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:03.000
Let’s go.

00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:14.760
(Don’t think too much, just let me kiss you.)

00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:17.960
(Don’t be afraid to love, just say...)

00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:20.200
(Just say you love me.)

00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:22.200
(Try thinking about it, hey.)

00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:24.400
(Before I kiss you, hey.)

00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:28.440
(But from what I see, you wanna kiss me too.)

00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:31.800
(I wanna kiss kiss you.)

00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:35.240
(I wanna love love you.)

00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:37.160
(I’m gonna kiss you.)

00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:40.360
(Kiss kiss kiss kiss you.)

00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:42.760
(One two three four five.)

00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:45.240
(Six seven eight nine ten and kiss.)

00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:51.840
(If someone told you they loved you,)

00:52:51.840 --> 00:52:55.880
(There’s no need to overthink it.)

00:52:55.880 --> 00:53:00.880
(Ten seconds is enough. If you don’t answer.)

00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:02.480
(One two three four five.)

00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:05.320
(Six seven eight nine ten and kiss.)

00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:28.640
Careful, slow down.

00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:50.000
Saint.

00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:16.160
Do you want to rehearse the scene together?

00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:20.360
I kinda want to see if Sea’s workshop

00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:23.760
really made us act better.

00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:27.000
Which scene?

00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:31.960
The one we left unfinished.

00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:44.400
If you want to,

00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:47.120
I’m fine with it.

00:54:56.520 --> 00:55:00.320
Does Kit have to start?

00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:10.840
What should Kit do?

00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:36.720
Close your eyes.

00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:42.360
But Kit wants to look at Seen?

00:56:44.840 --> 00:56:49.240
And does Kit want to kiss Seen?

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:01.880
Yeah.

00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:06.120
Can I kiss you, Seen?

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:12.040
If it’s Kit,

00:57:12.040 --> 00:57:14.040
he wouldn’t ask.

00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:08.440
(Is it still me that you love?)

00:58:08.440 --> 00:58:14.840
(Can it still be me that you miss?)

00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:20.000
(Because my broken heart still waits for your return.)

00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:26.440
(Just like when we were in love, I want to ask,)

00:58:56.080 --> 00:58:57.400
I'll go open it,

00:58:57.800 --> 00:58:58.960
you just wait here.

00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:24.200
Hello my love, did you miss me?

00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:27.680
Warm?

00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:48.720
Hey!

00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:51.720
I’ve been waiting forever for you to come out.

00:59:51.720 --> 00:59:53.360
I don’t want to lose you.

00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:56.120
Just tell me you like me.

00:59:56.120 --> 00:59:57.480
What were you doing just now?

00:59:57.480 --> 00:59:59.360
Did you forget you already have a boyfriend?

01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:02.360
I think I really need to stop

01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:03.960
seeing you in such a bad light.

01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:07.880
Then I’ll just stay here tonight.

01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:09.880
Or is there something at your condo

01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:11.080
that makes you want to go back so badly?

01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:12.680
Why did Ice come with Professor Mint?

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:14.560
Where are you going, Saint?

01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:15.560
I’m heading out.

01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:16.880
You can’t.

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:18.720
Mr.Khom gave strict orders.
