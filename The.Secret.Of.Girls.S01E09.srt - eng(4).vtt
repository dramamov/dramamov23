"The Secret of Girls"
(Episode 9)

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.940
Mr. Driver.

00:03:25.941 --> 00:03:27.580
We're not going to the hospital.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.820
So where are we going?

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:30.820
You decide.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.660
What do you want to eat?

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:34.220
BBQ?

00:03:34.221 --> 00:03:35.580
Hot pot?

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:37.820
Xu Jingxi?

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.500
Xu Jingxi?

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.220
Mr. driver, to the hospital, hurry up.

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:43.460
Xu Jingxi.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:45.076
So where do you want to go?

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.980
To the hospital

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:46.980
I'm so sorry.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:48.460
Xu Jingxi.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:54.540
Nurse.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:56.780
Nurse.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.980
Someone fainted.

00:03:57.981 --> 00:03:59.340
Could you please help me?

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:00.820
Thank you so much.

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.460
Help me.

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.739
Doctor Liu.

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:09.500
What happened?

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.980
What's wrong?

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.660
Doctor, she suddenly fainted.

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.139
And I don't know if she
was scared or hungry.

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:16.779
Just nopw she woke up
and then fainted again.

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:17.540
I don't know why.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:18.300
Let's have a check.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.300
Okay.

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:20.740
Family members are not allowed to enter.

00:04:20.741 --> 00:04:22.180
Go register at the desk.

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.180
Hello.

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:34.820
Hold on, please.

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:43.540
Thank you.

00:05:04.506 --> 00:05:05.506
Hey.

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.780
What's going on?

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:12.780
Go pay the fee.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:14.260
But doctor...

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.620
I'm fine, don't worry.

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:19.819
The doctor said that
I got a little low blood sugar.

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:20.940
A bit anemic.

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:22.619
Also I had stomachache because of hunger.

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:23.620
A stomachache?

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:25.260
Sit down.

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:29.580
Sit here for a bit.

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:31.900
I've promised to treat you a big meal.

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:32.980
But now

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.580
I don't know if there are
any restaurants open this late.

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.420
You're so sick but still
want to go out to eat?

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:41.900
You stay here

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.220
I'll go pay the fee.

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:44.820
But where should we go for food?

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:46.180
Home.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.300
Noodles.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:01.260
Great, let's go.

00:06:01.261 --> 00:06:02.700
Be careful.

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:05.460
You lay down first

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:06.940
I'll go to cook the noodles.

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:11.260
Let me sleep on the bed today.

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:12.779
How could I be so cruel?

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.260
Let a sick person sleep on the floor.

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:15.980
OK

00:06:15.981 --> 00:06:17.179
Lay down.

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:18.180
Come here.

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.500
I feel better now.

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:24.340
I'm not that fragile.

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:25.980
The doctor said

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:27.460
I had low blood sugar.

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:28.900
It's not like I'm pregnant.

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:30.980
The child has to be mine.

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:34.940
You can also tell jokes.

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:37.180
OK, take a rest

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:38.420
I'll go make the noodles.

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:16.460
Try it.

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:26.380
Why is yours so ugly?

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:31.460
Can't you tell I gave you the good one?

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:44.380
How does it taste?

00:07:47.201 --> 00:07:48.220
Actually, I realized...

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:51.100
the noodles you cook are really delicious.

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:53.420
You're too hungry.

00:07:53.421 --> 00:07:54.580
Anything would taste good.

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:57.220
No, I'm honest.

00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:59.420
I can eat them again tomorrow for lunch.

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:01.660
Really?

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:03.300
Can I?

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:05.140
OK

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:11.700
I realized...

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:14.099
when we went to the hospital,

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:15.620
you took the initiative to hold me up.

00:08:16.967 --> 00:08:18.167
Doesn't it seem that...

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:21.060
you're not that averse to
human touch anymore?

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:25.100
You are right.

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:28.820
Not just at the hospital.

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:31.340
I held you up when you fainted in the bar.

00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:34.740
I carried you to the hospital
after getting out of the car.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:39.820
Does that mean...

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:42.980
you're not so unwillling towards me?

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:47.900
Maybe.

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:51.340
You are the first one.

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:00.620
Do you want to talk about it?

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:02.100
About what?

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:04.140
About...

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:06.780
why you refuse physical contact.

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:13.460
It's a secret I've never
talked about with other people.

00:09:15.267 --> 00:09:16.267
You want to know?

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:21.180
I'm not gossiping.

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:23.660
I Just want to get to know you more.

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:28.260
How about you give me a secret to swap?

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:31.540
I have no secrets.

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:33.980
Really?

00:09:36.073 --> 00:09:37.073
In that case...

00:09:37.893 --> 00:09:40.413
how about you answer questions I ask you?

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:50.540
Why did you argue with your mom?

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:51.820
Why did you come here?

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:56.820
Because of money.

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:20.420
Hello?

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:21.700
Hello.

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:23.739
Is this Miss Xu Jingxi?

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:24.740
Yes.

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:26.820
This is the physical examination center.

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:28.940
Hello.

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:32.140
The results of the physical exam have
finished, we've sent them to your email.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.340
Some of the examination indicators
are much higher than the normal values.

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:39.060
And the CT scan shows
there's a possible tumor in your pancreas.

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:42.540
Our suggestion is for you to go to
the hospital for a detailed examination.

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:46.140
What kind of tumor?

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:49.580
The doctor's note is
"suspected pancreatic cancer."

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:53.340
But for specific analysis, please go to the
hospital for a check-up as soon as possible.

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:01.820
Got it, thank you so much.

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:53.540
I was fired by my company.

00:11:54.554 --> 00:11:55.580
I have no income.

00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:57.140
I need money.

00:11:57.740 --> 00:11:59.020
What do you need money for?

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:01.700
Just for traveling.

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:06.540
Do you think

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:11.060
my reasoning is very
immature and ignorant?

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:14.620
A person like me at this age,

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:16.740
no work,

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:18.140
no income,

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:20.380
when I go travelling,

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:22.500
I still ask my parents for money,

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:24.820
I even fought with my mom about it.
