"The Secret of Girls"
(Episode 10)

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.260
Do you think I'm ignorant?

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:33.500
What's wrong?

00:03:33.501 --> 00:03:34.700
It's fine.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:47.660
Mom.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.700
Why don't you reply to my messages?

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:52.980
How can I reply to you?

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.340
You just come back for money.

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.420
Right?

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.653
I called you asking to give me some
money, and you didn't answer me.

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.100
So I came back.

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.059
You doing well at your
job out in the world?

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.220
Running back home asking for money.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.420
But I scrimp and I save every month.

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.899
I gave you my whole paycheque.

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.500
You said you would save it for me,

00:04:22.787 --> 00:04:25.507
so I came back to ask you for
money because I had an emergency.

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.900
Doesn't your money belong to the family?

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:30.500
Look at you.

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.099
From childhood to adulthood

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.100
I provided you with
food, drink and education.

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:36.959
What part of the money you give is yours?

00:04:37.006 --> 00:04:38.006
Go ahead and tell me.

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.100
Let me tell you.

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:41.580
There is no money left.

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:43.460
Even you ask me for it, there's none.

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:47.780
Where is there none left?

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:50.659
Your little brother is in a relationship.

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.179
They plan to get married next year.

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.700
So we have to buy a house.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.620
Your father and I have
taken out all our savings.

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.700
It's still not enough for the down payment.

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.539
Adding your little bit of cash,

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.540
we can barely put an offer in on the house.

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.300
What money could we have left?

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:11.820
Buying a house?

00:05:11.821 --> 00:05:12.860
Yes.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.220
Every man has to buy
a house to start a family.

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.340
Otherwise, where will the
children live in the future?

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.060
Do you think everyone is the same as you?

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:24.340
Tell me.

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.699
I introduced you to so many people.

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:27.819
You didn't even go to meet them.

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:28.820
You didn't get married.

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:34.100
If you got married earlier and had a dowry,
we wouldn't have been so strapped for cash.

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.180
And that house we got,

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.739
we have to pay 4000 yuan
back every month for the loan.

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.979
You only give back 3,000 yuan.

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.780
It's not even enough to pay back the loan.

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:45.780
How about this,

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.540
save a little more each month.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.460
Get up to 4,000 yuan.

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:56.020
If it's not enough, your father
and I will make up the rest.

00:05:57.193 --> 00:05:58.273
It's almost enough.

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:59.580
By the way.

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.580
This doesn't even include the bride price.

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.220
What else is there for me to save?

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.339
Don't eat out a couple times in a month.

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:16.939
Buy a couple fewer pieces of clothing.

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:18.539
You can easily save 500 yuan.

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:19.900
What do you mean you can't save?

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:24.860
I was fired.

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:27.900
And I'm not going to work.

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.580
You two handle the mortgage on your own.

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:34.020
Don't count on me.

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:38.380
How can you talk to me like this?

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:40.059
I raised you up.

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:41.580
And you talk to me like this?

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:42.859
I see you for who you are now.

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.420
You are an ungrateful person.

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.259
That's your brother.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:47.140
You don't care about him.

00:06:47.141 --> 00:06:48.660
I can't!

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.340
What do you mean by that?

00:06:56.853 --> 00:06:57.853
You.

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.220
You always say that I am unfilial.

00:07:01.595 --> 00:07:02.795
Well what about you?

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:03.860
What's wrong with me?

00:07:03.885 --> 00:07:05.285
What's wrong with me?

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:08.260
Have you ever fulfilled your
responsibilities as a mother?

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:12.780
Have you ever cared
about me since I came back?

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:16.260
Did you ask me why I need the money?

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.019
Why do you need the money?

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:21.259
You're an adult now, aren't you?

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:22.940
You have your own way of thinking.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.540
Who knows why you need money?

00:07:26.133 --> 00:07:28.773
You gave money to your parents
and then came back to ask for it.

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:30.740
You can ask others.

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:32.980
Who else has a daughter like you?

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:34.580
Is there anyone like you?

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:47.419
Say something.

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:49.580
How about 4000 yuan?

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:57.220
I am not filial.

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:01.220
I am not worthy of being your daughter.

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:05.100
From now on,

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:07.700
just pretend you never gave birth to me.

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:10.060
You.

00:08:10.346 --> 00:08:12.626
What are you talking about.

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:16.380
What are you going to do?

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:42.580
Hello, doctor.

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:43.580
Hello.

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:45.700
Could you please have a look?

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:52.860
You can see here.

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:54.420
Just here.

00:08:54.421 --> 00:08:57.500
The tumor diameter is longer than 5 cm.

00:08:58.180 --> 00:08:58.700
And.

00:08:58.701 --> 00:09:02.660
There seems to be lymph node
and organ migration occuring.

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:07.940
What do you mean?

00:09:08.182 --> 00:09:09.060
What I mean is...

00:09:09.061 --> 00:09:11.740
judging from the indications
and what the CT scan shows,

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:15.420
you're already in the late stages of it.

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:24.660
Late.

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:26.580
Late stage.

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:28.740
So...

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:30.780
Then...

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:35.580
So..

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:38.339
How long do you think I will live?

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:42.059
Is there any sort of... treatment plan?

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:44.499
Surgery or...

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:46.140
hospitalization?

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:49.980
Judging from your course of illness.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:52.940
It is impossible to have surgery.

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:56.620
But you can choose
chemotherapy or radiotherapy.

00:09:58.220 --> 00:09:59.780
If the treatment goes well,

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:02.259
you might have an extra few months.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:03.260
That's very likely.

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:10.540
And...

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:14.780
The fee...

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:17.940
It depends on how long
the treatment goes on for.

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:18.980
But.

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:21.020
It will still cost hundreds
of thousands yuan.

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:26.020
I undertand.

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:26.740
Thank you.

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:27.900
Don't be worried.

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:29.140
Don't be worried.

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:33.780
The last words I said to
my mother before I left were,

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:37.100
for her to pretend like she
never had a daughter like me.

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:45.620
Ever since I was old enough to understand,

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:47.660
my parents told me that,

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:49.580
girls should be ambitious,

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:51.340
they should work hard.

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:55.660
Only then will they be respected by others.

00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:58.660
Only then will they have a good job.

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:01.180
I have worked hard.

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:08.340
Actually, I'm not particularly intelligent.

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:11.780
But I've tried my hardest.

00:11:12.906 --> 00:11:16.180
I managed to get to Beijing
and attend university there.

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:17.820
Graduated.

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:18.980
Worked.

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:20.980
Isn't that something to be proud of?

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:25.860
When I was in my third year,

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:28.500
my little brother got in to university too.

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:30.980
He was not good at studying.

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:34.300
His tuition was very expensive.

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:37.540
My parents couldn't
afford tuition for two people,

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:39.460
so I picked up a part-time job.

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:42.900
To earn money, to pay for my own fees.

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:46.540
After I started working,

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:51.860
All the money I earned, other
than expenses like food and rent,

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:55.340
I gave all the rest to my mother.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:11:59.900
There's very little ignorance in you.

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:10.540
My classmates gave me a nickname.

00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:15.236
They called me "Voldemort" [TN: A pun/slang
for women who are devoted to their family]

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:16.700
Actually, I never thought

00:12:17.293 --> 00:12:19.733
that it was wrong to give the
money I earned to my parents.

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:26.540
I don't think it's wrong
for me to have a younger brother either.

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:30.740
They're my kin.

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:33.620
They are related to me by blood.

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:36.900
The closest people in the world.

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:41.540
I try my best to be good to them.

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:43.900
It's not wrong.

00:12:46.613 --> 00:12:47.053
It's just that...

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:48.940
the biggest mistake is...

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:54.060
I was not chosen.

00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:59.480
It's not that I can't be
good to my brother.

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:07.580
Why can't I be the one that was chosen?
