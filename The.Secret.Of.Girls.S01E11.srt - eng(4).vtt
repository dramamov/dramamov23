"The Secret of Girls"
(Episode 11)

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:34.820
Did you know?

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.100
Lots of people like
to watch strong female led dramas.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.380
They find it very enjoyable.

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.100
So they fantasize about
being the strong female lead.

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:45.540
But.

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.660
There aren't so many strong
female lead in this world.

00:03:49.313 --> 00:03:50.313
Right.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:52.780
So someone like me.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.540
A real person.

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.020
A normal person.

00:03:58.005 --> 00:03:59.645
Isn't someone like that worth being seen?

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:09.700
This trip...

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.500
it's my first time to take plane.

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.140
It's my first time to travel.

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.140
It's my first time just for myself.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.020
To see the world.

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.300
Do you need a hug?

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:43.380
It's fine.

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.100
Don't cry.

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:47.740
It's fine.

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:56.940
I know.

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:59.420
Xu Jingxi.

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.180
When you are here,

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.140
you can be yourself all the time.

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:04.780
Got it?

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.300
Got it.

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.620
Did I look ugly when I cried just now?

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:26.980
A little.

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:29.900
If you can't say something
good, please be quiet.

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.100
You are beautiful even when you cry.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:38.460
Liar.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.620
When I was in junior high school,

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:52.860
it was far away from home.

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.220
I only came back on weekends.

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:01.620
There was only one bus that went to school.

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.619
It was always very crowded.

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:05.620
And full of people.

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:07.300
Once on my way home,

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:09.580
the bus was so crowded,

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.220
it was difficult to even turn around.

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.420
And then...

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.100
I felt a hand

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:21.860
going through my school uniform,

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:24.140
reaching into my clothes underneath.

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.780
That hand stuck close to my skin.

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:30.580
At that time I didn't realize.

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:31.580
I...

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.300
I just felt very scared.

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.260
But I was too afraid to
scream or make a sound.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:37.859
Because there were so many people.

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:41.020
It was so crowded that I couldn't
even turn around or move.

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:42.540
I waited until

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:44.419
the next stop

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:45.740
to get off the bus.

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.020
I pushed my way off the
bus with all my strength.

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:49.180
When I got off the bus

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.060
I looked back.

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.420
But I didn't even know who did it.

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:00.580
That night,

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:04.980
I walked for very long time
until I made it back home.

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:08.580
I didn't dare tell my parents.

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:11.259
I couldn't sleep that night

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:11.980
I became an insomniac.

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.580
As soon as I closed
my eyes, I saw that day.

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.700
The iamge of me on the bus.

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.300
I told my mom next day.

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:26.500
My mom cried and scolded me.

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:30.460
She said why was it me,
why wasn't it someone else.

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:33.219
Why didn't I get away?

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.220
Why couldn't I even figure
out who that person was?

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:42.540
I couldn't say anything.

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:48.300
Finally my mother said...

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:52.900
she said I brought her shame.

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:56.620
Under no circumstance
could I tell someone else.

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:58.700
She said it would damage my reputation.

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:01.339
From then on

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:03.339
every problem I ran into,

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:05.740
I felt... like it was my fault.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.900
I started to be suspicious
of the people around me.

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:11.980
I started staying away from them.

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:16.060
Gradually I unconsciously
slipped into my own body.

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:19.020
I avoided everything.

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:21.260
All possible physical contact.

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:24.780
But it was obviously not my fault.

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:28.300
Then...
then I started to suffer from insomnia.

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:30.580
I couldn't sleep all night.

00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:32.860
But you know,

00:08:32.861 --> 00:08:34.101
night time is especially quiet.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:37.460
I like looking the moon.

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:46.660
I think...
the moon at night...

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:49.380
belongs to me alone.

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:54.420
I enjoy the night.

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:56.180
I enjoy the loneliness.

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:07.540
Maybe I never got off that bus.

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:12.540
So...

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:15.300
that day I came to your room...

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:17.940
I broke your sense of security.

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:20.420
You can't sleep again.

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:22.540
You went out to look at the moon, right?

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:24.620
I'm so sorry.

00:09:25.573 --> 00:09:27.373
I know you mean well.

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:30.740
Don't be sorry.

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:41.700
Are you saying that you are not
so resistant to me anymore?

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:46.660
Yeah, not recently.

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:50.660
That's a good beginning.

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:53.940
Maybe

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:56.660
I can help you to leave the darkness.

00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:02.740
Maybe I'll be the one to save you?

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:03.740
Look.

00:10:03.741 --> 00:10:06.020
God sent me here to meet you.

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:06.740
Right?

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:09.420
That's how it's played in TV dramas anyway.

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:13.820
So what will you do?

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:17.740
I have no idea now.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.040
But...

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:21.620
I need to give it a shot first.

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:23.180
First...

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:26.100
it starts from taking a step.

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:28.140
For example...

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:30.720
For example...

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:34.220
Let's sleep in one bed tonight.

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:38.980
You were just waiting this chance.

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:40.819
Can I?

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:42.420
I don't want to sleep on the floor.

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:44.500
Can I?

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:47.780
Did you finish?

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:49.460
Yes.

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:51.300
OK

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:52.979
Let's wash the dishes

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:53.980
I'll go wash up.

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:15.860
Are you sleeping?

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:18.260
No.

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:20.620
Are you sleepy?

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:27.140
How can you not be sleepy
after tossing and turning all night?

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:32.260
Do you feel nervous
when I sleep beside you?

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:34.060
Are you OK with it?

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:35.820
Yeah.

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:39.940
That's good.

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:58.220
Will you fall asleep if I
lie by your side like this?

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:02.820
Why do I feel that you
are more nervous than me?

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:09.020
Probably because I'm afraid that
you are nervous to be beside me.

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:11.660
And that makes me a
little nervous to fall asleep.

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:16.860
I'm not nervous.

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:18.740
And I'm very sleepy now.

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:21.540
I might fall asleep if
I'm quiet for a while.

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:23.900
But I still can't sleep.

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:27.220
So what should we do?

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:31.500
How about...

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:33.899
Sing me a song to put me to sleep.

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:35.140
Then I'll probably fall asleep.

00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:39.660
Xu Jingxi.

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:43.220
Who's the one with a sleeping problem?

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:48.260
Go to sleep.

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:50.140
Close your eyes.

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:17.620
Good night, Wen Shan.

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:20.980
Good night
