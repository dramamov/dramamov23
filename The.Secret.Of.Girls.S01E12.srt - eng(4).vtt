"The Secret of Girls"
(Episode 12)

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.020
So cold.

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:18.540
Put it on.

00:04:18.541 --> 00:04:19.780
No.

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:21.740
It looks so pretty.

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.020
Too cold.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:17.260
Put on an apron.

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:20.260
Hurry up.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:21.260
Nope.

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:33.460
Great.

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:06.780
You're done?

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:07.500
I'm full.

00:06:07.501 --> 00:06:08.980
Take it easy.

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:10.860
Clean it up.

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:18.740
Hey, Sis Yun.

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:27.580
This is so good.

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:37.740
Hello.

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:41.820
A new concoction.

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:42.820
Try it.

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:46.660
How is it?

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:48.740
It's so strong!

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:50.260
How many types did you use?

00:06:50.715 --> 00:06:52.475
It doesn't matter what types I use.

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:53.860
You're not sensitive to alcohol.

00:06:54.632 --> 00:06:55.032
Qiu Bei.

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:57.100
This is the order for table 6, take a look.

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.020
Hi, Sis Yun.

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:02.459
Aren't you tired after
taking care of the inn all day?

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:03.620
Why do you come here to work?

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:05.300
I'm not very tired.

00:07:05.475 --> 00:07:06.956
Then, I won't interrupt your conversation.

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:08.260
I'll go take care of things.

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:13.380
Hey, what's wrong with you?

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:14.819
She is my employee.

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:16.420
Why is she working here?

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:18.379
I don't ask her to come here.

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:19.740
I don't give her a salary.

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:22.180
That makes me even more uncomfortable

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:23.980
I still pay her salary.

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.580
And she runs to you to work here for free.

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:29.460
By the way.

00:07:29.461 --> 00:07:31.780
You are the major
shareholder of this bar, right?

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:34.460
Working for me for free is
the same as working for you.

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:37.220
That seems to make sense.

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:39.940
So I'm the one who got the advantage.

00:07:40.486 --> 00:07:41.486
Yes.

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:43.379
She comes here to pick up Wen Shan.

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.020
While she's here she helps out with work.

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:47.980
But then again...

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:49.740
Ever since Xu Jingxi came,

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:51.740
Wen Shan has become happy.

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:53.819
No more sour face.

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:55.060
No more snarky words.

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:56.340
To be honest

00:07:56.341 --> 00:07:57.860
I'm quite happy for her.

00:07:58.420 --> 00:07:59.420
Really?

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:00.660
That's great.

00:08:01.315 --> 00:08:03.940
But Xu Jingxi said
she'll go back in a few days.

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:05.580
To where?

00:08:05.619 --> 00:08:06.819
Maybe her hometown.

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:08.459
After all, she's lived
in city for a long time.

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:10.380
Unlike us who have settled down here.

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:19.660
It's great to be young.

00:08:21.755 --> 00:08:22.755
You're young, too.

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:29.140
Qiu Bei.

00:08:29.141 --> 00:08:30.620
The guests are starving.

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:45.740
Look.

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:48.580
Now you don't refuse
physical contact at all.

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:52.340
You don't have any reaction
when I hold your hand casually.

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:55.140
Do I need to say thank you?

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:56.820
Of course.

00:08:57.540 --> 00:08:59.100
Fine, thank you.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:00.260
You are welcome.

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:09.300
What's up?

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:13.220
Let's try something else.

00:09:13.869 --> 00:09:15.300
Try what?

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:36.620
It seems like hugging is OK.

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:53.740
Then my mission is completed.

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:56.740
Wen Shan.

00:09:58.380 --> 00:09:59.380
I'm going to leave.

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:05.420
Don't move.

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:09.100
Where are you going?

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:11.140
Back home.

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:16.740
I've spent too much time here.

00:10:17.526 --> 00:10:18.526
Wen Shan.

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:20.700
I hate saying goodbye too.

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:24.980
So don't move.

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:27.620
Let me hold you a little longer, please.

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:35.820
Wen Shan.

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:41.820
I'm so glad to have met you.

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:46.660
Me, too.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:50.620
After I'm gone,

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:54.260
you have to take care of yourself.

00:10:56.499 --> 00:10:57.499
You...

00:10:59.546 --> 00:11:00.826
Can you stay here.?

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:16.380
Why are you crying like this?

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:19.940
No, the weather is too dry.

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:22.780
Do you not want to let me go?

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:25.900
Just go back.

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:26.820
Do you not want to let me go?

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:27.820
Go back now.

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:36.980
Are you leaving now?

00:11:37.005 --> 00:11:38.325
No staying for an extra few days?

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:40.059
I can't, something happened at home,

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:41.260
I have to go back.

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:42.940
OK

00:11:42.941 --> 00:11:44.379
Then come next time.

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:45.859
You need to come back!

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:47.499
I'll miss you.

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:49.180
Go back to work.

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:50.900
Bye, be careful.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:11:59.620
Do you have anything to say to me?

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:06.499
Jingxi

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:08.540
I really don't want to let you go.

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:13.340
After you're gone, I don't
know when we'll meet again.

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:16.259
I got up early to see you off

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:17.380
I'm so sleepy.

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:18.700
Look at my wrinkles.

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:20.436
But it's not as important
as seeing you off.

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:22.100
I don't want to leave you either.

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:24.780
Thank you for taking care of me.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:26.460
I hope to see you again.

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:27.540
It'll definitely happen.

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:32.660
You guys.

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:34.940
Don't you want to say anything?

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:37.060
I'll go if no.

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:42.580
You.

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:45.780
While you're being more
proactive in the future,

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:48.100
You have to be proactive
with your heart as well.

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:07.580
I'm leaving.

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:08.980
Take care.

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:11.380
Are you not seeing me off?

00:13:14.006 --> 00:13:15.246
Do you not want to let me go?

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:18.260
Go back.

00:13:18.261 --> 00:13:19.379
Do you not want to let me go?

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:20.780
Go back
