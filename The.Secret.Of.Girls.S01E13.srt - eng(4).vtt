"The Secret of Girls"
(Episode 13)

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.100
Instant noodles are also delicious

00:04:23.101 --> 00:04:24.260
I like this taste the most.

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.140
Great.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:02.500
Hello doctor.

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.139
Why did you come alone?

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.340
Where are your family members?

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:09.980
It doesn't matter.

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.060
I'm mentally prepared.

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.020
According to the
characteristics of your pathology,

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.980
there are some symptoms
that have appeared before.

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.659
For example, you fainted and vomitted.

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:22.580
These are normal reactions at this stage.

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:24.620
But in the future,

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.340
these symptoms may become more common.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.620
The frequency between
instances may decrease as well.

00:05:30.413 --> 00:05:32.173
The worsening will move quickly,

00:05:32.792 --> 00:05:33.792
until...

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:36.380
I got it.

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:37.420
Thank you doctor.

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:40.219
Doctor, please give me
some more painkillers.

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:41.220
Thank you.

00:08:03.026 --> 00:08:04.226
You haven't fallen asleep yet.

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:09.140
What are you laughing at?

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:10.860
You aren't sleeping, either.

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:14.340
I fell asleep.

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:16.660
I woke up.

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:21.940
I looked at your message.

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:29.740
Have you become an insomniac again?

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:39.780
You...

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:43.580
Are you OK?

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:49.740
Yes, I'm fine.

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:52.740
Let me tell you.

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:56.260
I cleaned up the house
for the past two days.

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:58.100
I also went for an interview.

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:01.460
I received a new offer.

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:03.860
It's a international company.

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:05.460
Maybe in the future,

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:07.180
when I start working,

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:09.700
I'll be particularly busy.

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:13.340
But I can earn so more much money.

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:18.500
Maybe I'll be so busy that
I won't have time to eat.

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:20.260
No time to go out for fun.

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:24.380
Maybe I'll go abroad.

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:35.620
Wen Shan.

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:39.940
If I go abroad,

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:42.540
I might...

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:45.780
not be able to contact you.

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:50.500
There may be a time difference.

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:52.180
It's also possible

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:54.820
that I won't see you again.

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:57.100
Wen Shan.

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:01.660
Take care of yourself.

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:05.140
Xu Jingxi.

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:10.620
Can you see the moon there?

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:19.140
Yes, I can.

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:22.220
Isn't it...

00:10:22.493 --> 00:10:23.613
big and round?

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:29.460
It's big...

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:31.420
bright...

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:33.500
and round.

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:36.420
So...

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:39.580
don't be afraid.

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:42.500
Even if you are busy working abroad,

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:45.179
or we can't contact each other,

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:48.020
you must remember to
look up at the night sky.

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:51.620
We can see the same moon.

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:56.140
Great.

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:01.540
We can see the same moon.

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:09.740
Go to sleep.

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:12.660
Good night.

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:28.779
Sister Shan, this is the key
for check-out room in the morning.

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:30.339
And I'll take this lady to her room.

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:31.180
Give me the key.

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:32.180
Sure.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:33.260
The key.

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:40.380
This isn't the one.

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:43.740
I'm sorry.

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:46.820
Here you are.

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:48.820
Take care.

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:49.820
Let's go, miss

00:11:49.821 --> 00:11:50.940
I'll take you to the room.

00:11:55.915 --> 00:11:58.948
"♪With♪ You" "I'm Here"

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:02.410
[A wind chime with "hear
the wind" written on it]

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:04.620
Hello.

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:19.660
I

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:22.740
I've lost my cellphone and ID card.

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:24.820
Can I check in?

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:31.060
I'm so sorry, guest.

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:34.540
You can't check in without your ID card.

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:39.300
I see.

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:44.220
But our workers earn 100 yuan a day.

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:45.860
Including food and board.

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:47.620
Are you willing?

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:55.660
You look thinner.
