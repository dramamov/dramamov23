"The Secret of Girls"
(Episode 14)

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.900
Come on.

00:03:26.901 --> 00:03:28.059
Let's grab a drink.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.580
Let's celebrate that Xu Jingxi's back.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.180
Welcome.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:34.860
Don't drink too much.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.100
Jingxi.

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.139
To tell the truth I've thought
that you would come back.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.020
But I didn't expect that
you came back so soon.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.820
Why, am I not welcome?

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.060
How could you think that?

00:03:44.061 --> 00:03:45.300
I'm very happy for your back.

00:03:45.853 --> 00:03:48.013
You're happy that
you have someone working for you.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.100
I'm not that snobbish.

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:52.420
As for me

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.059
I'm happy when I'm happy.

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.180
Unlike some people
who say one thing and mean another.

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.820
In their hearts they're very happy.

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.076
But they're still so cold on the surface.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.940
Who?

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.180
Who says one thing and means another?

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:06.300
You.

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.700
What did I do?

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.739
You're good.

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:11.740
Very good.

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.139
Ignore her.

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.180
She's all mixed up.

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:15.780
But having said that.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.556
Have you done what you needed to do?

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:18.940
Pretty much.

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:20.300
But Sister Yun

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:23.700
I probably won't have time
to work in the Inn this time.

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:24.660
Why?

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:25.660
You need to leave?

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.299
I came here for travel last time.

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.339
But something unexpected happened

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.419
and I lost all my things.

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:31.340
I didn't finish traveling.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.020
So...

00:04:32.021 --> 00:04:33.059
this time, I've decided that

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.820
I'll take a good look around.

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.499
I heard that the sunrise
here is very beautiful.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.820
That's right.

00:04:36.821 --> 00:04:38.339
You should spend a good time here.

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.140
The natural scenery is so great here.

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.299
And there's that market.

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.980
It's very beautiful.

00:04:42.981 --> 00:04:44.220
Many young people go there.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:45.340
Wen Shan.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:46.300
Take her to play for few days

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.300
I give you two days off.

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:49.140
No problem.

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:50.540
You can use my car.

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:51.500
Go play around more.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:52.300
Okay.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.260
Thank you, Qiu Bei.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.179
Why are you only thanking Qiu Bei?

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:57.340
I bought her the car.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:58.500
Okay.

00:04:58.525 --> 00:05:00.965
The most important is
saying thank you to Sister Yun.

00:05:01.355 --> 00:05:02.755
But Sister Yun, please drink less.

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.179
You drink so quickly.

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.420
Don't get too drunk.

00:05:05.813 --> 00:05:08.093
Her tolerance to alcohol is wild.

00:05:08.188 --> 00:05:09.468
I've never seen her drunk.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:10.500
Really?

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.060
Why do I feel that you
always want to get me drunk?

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:14.259
Tell me the truth.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:15.940
Does it benefit you if I get drunk?

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.139
No

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:18.660
I just haven't seen it

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.100
I'm curious.

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.716
But to be honest
Sister Yun really hasn't drank much.

00:05:22.955 --> 00:05:24.196
Is her tolerance really that good?

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:25.220
No

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:26.340
I am so jealous.

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:27.499
You should be envious.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:28.500
Wen Shan.

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:29.939
When Xu Jingxi was drunk last time,

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.140
did she hug your neck
and cry and make a scene?

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.219
How can you remember that so clearly?

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.020
Who got drunk and hugged
you while making a scene...

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:38.900
Talk about it!

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:41.940
Lame.

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:42.300
Come on.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.780
Have a drink.

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:43.780
Stop making a scene.

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:45.220
Quickly

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:46.499
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:47.500
Are you trying to avoid drinking?

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:48.020
No

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:49.260
I'll come back soon.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.300
Hurry up.

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.099
Look, you've been called shy.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.100
It's all your fault.

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:58.660
When did you come back?

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:02.220
Just now.

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:09.820
Are you feeling sick?

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:11.700
I'm fine

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:14.613
I just... woke up so early in the morning.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:15.320
I'm tired.

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:16.700
Everything is OK.

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:20.180
Don't go.

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:21.380
Lay down.

00:07:21.766 --> 00:07:22.766
I'm fine.

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:24.940
We're almost done eating.

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:26.540
I'll clean up.

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:27.580
Lay down there.

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:28.380
Don't worry about it.

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:29.380
It's okay.

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:30.580
It's not very good.

00:07:30.581 --> 00:07:31.980
Let me help you.

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:34.060
You go to have a rest.

00:07:37.073 --> 00:07:38.673
Why are you so mean?

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:40.620
Come here.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.060
Have a good rest.

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:15.780
Are you fall asleep?

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:19.580
What's wrong?

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:28.460
You've found a job, right?

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.180
Emmm...

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:37.940
I don't want it.

00:08:38.853 --> 00:08:40.453
Why?

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:44.500
Have a guess.

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:46.420
No, I don't.

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:49.140
It's boring.

00:08:53.066 --> 00:08:54.066
Because of me?

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:10.340
I'm afraid of that someone can't sleep well

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:12.660
because of my absence.

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:16.300
And then they go to work with dark circles
under their eyes the next day,

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:18.100
and scare away the customers.

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:21.700
Who? I don't know.

00:09:22.387 --> 00:09:23.187
Right.

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:24.540
Who could it be?

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:26.540
I don't know, either.

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:30.180
Mine is an ailment of the soul.

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:32.900
It can't be changed overnight

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:34.820
I've tried my best.

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:37.780
You're great.

00:09:40.987 --> 00:09:42.267
How long can you stay with me?

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:45.980
For a lifetime?

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:57.660
Wen Shan.

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:02.620
I don't know how long
that I can stay with you.

00:10:06.766 --> 00:10:07.766
But...

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:11.300
If I can be next to you,

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:14.180
you could sleep well,

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:16.660
and gradually move away from the darkness,

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:20.060
I hope I could be with you for a long time.

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:25.300
Wen Shan.

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:32.900
I don't have anyone worth caring about.

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:39.060
Of course, it seems that
no one cares about me.

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:43.060
But...

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:45.460
people go on living,

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:48.940
there must be something to care about.

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:50.460
Someone to care about.

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:53.820
Only in times of pain and despair.

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:56.260
Can people live a good life,

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:58.340
and try their best to live.

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:01.500
Only in this way can life be valuable.

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:04.420
Even a little bit of it is good.

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:07.140
Now.

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:11.780
You are the one that I care about the most.
