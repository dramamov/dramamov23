"The Secret of Girls"
(Episode 15)

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:36.740
Drive safely.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:38.580
Don't worry.

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.380
Let me, it's very heavy.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:50.700
I'm not that weak.

00:03:50.701 --> 00:03:52.181
I can't even carry a box? How's that?

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.059
You didn't sleep well last night.

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.060
Get in the car first.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:56.580
Okay.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:57.779
Oh, I forget to bring the fruits.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:58.996
Let me go back to the room to get them.

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:00.020
Give me the bag.

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.140
I'll take the fruits.

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.140
Thanks for always looking
out for me, Sister Yun.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.780
Come on, that's sounds so cheesy.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.220
Have a good time with Wen Shan.

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:18.580
Let's go drink after you back.

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:19.860
No problem.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:24.100
What?

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.140
She wants to give you a hug.

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.140
Come on.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.820
I need to go now.

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:31.820
Sure.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:38.660
Good-bye, sister Yun.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:39.460
Good-bye, Qiu Bei.

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:40.460
Bye.

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.820
We were planning a road trip
since we bought the car.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.220
But we still haven't gone on one.

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.540
They went before us.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:56.540
Well.

00:04:56.541 --> 00:04:58.420
Wait til they get back and we'll go.

00:04:58.903 --> 00:04:59.940
Can I believe you?

00:05:00.143 --> 00:05:01.623
It's bad luck if you break your word.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:02.660
It's a deal.

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:29.740
You're too close.

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:31.979
No, you're still good looking.

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:32.980
Let me have a look.

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:38.940
You're really professional.

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:40.740
Professional Miss Wen Shan.

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:46.740
Actually, I'm not sure how it tastes.

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:47.740
Try it.

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:59.180
It tastes amazing.

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:00.220
Let me try it again.

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:01.300
Cheers!

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:13.366
If you take bad photos, I'll kiil you!

00:06:13.391 --> 00:06:14.988
So good, so pretty.

00:06:15.013 --> 00:06:16.013
Seriously?

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:23.100
Have fun today?

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:23.980
Yes!

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:24.860
You sure?

00:06:24.861 --> 00:06:26.020
Then give us a smile!

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:27.420
Laugh out loud!

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:29.140
Loudly!

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:30.140
Again!

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:58.580
So many strawberries.

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:15.300
Xu Jingxi.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:23.260
Xu Jingxi.

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:28.100
Xu Jingxi.

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:35.940
We're here.

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:38.260
We're at the hotel.

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:39.660
All right.

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:41.620
Are you OK? Was it difficult?

00:08:42.466 --> 00:08:45.626
No, I've just been tired the past few days.

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:53.820
It's good that you don't have a fever.

00:08:57.293 --> 00:08:58.573
Let's get out first.

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:00.340
Okay.

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:02.340
Let me get luggage for you.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:03.620
Take a seat and wait for me.

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:04.740
I'll take them.

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:30.900
Everything's all set.

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:34.300
Water and food are all in the backpacks.

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:36.620
Great.

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:42.700
Does your stomach still hurt?

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:46.020
Better now.

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:52.220
Otherwise, we don't have to
go see the sunrise tomorrow.

00:09:52.788 --> 00:09:53.860
Let's go to see a doctor.

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:57.340
You look very haggard.

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:00.340
No.

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:04.740
I took my pills already.

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:05.900
And I'm feeling better.

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:06.900
It doesn't hurt.

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:09.060
And you know.

00:10:09.061 --> 00:10:11.180
Stomachaches are a common problem for me.

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:14.500
I want to see the sunrise.

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:20.420
Then please promise me.

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:23.700
Anytime you're not feeling
good, you gotta let me know.

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:25.340
Don't force it.

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:28.140
We can always see the sunrise another time,
right?

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:32.860
Get some sleep.

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:36.460
We gotta get up early tomorrow.

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:38.220
Come on, let's tuck you in.

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:39.220
Don't catch a chill.

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:48.460
Good night.

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:04.180
Good night.

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:20.420
Are you alright?

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:22.500
Sure.

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:23.540
We're nearly there,

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:24.540
it's just ahead.

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:34.300
Tired?

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:36.260
I'm okay now.

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:39.580
Drink some water.

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:45.300
Be careful.

00:11:51.733 --> 00:11:53.293
There's still some time before sunrise.

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:54.580
Let's have a rest now.

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:56.500
By the way

00:11:56.501 --> 00:11:57.620
I bought some food.

00:11:57.660 --> 00:11:58.660
Would you like some?

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:00.420
I am not hungry.

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:02.420
I don't want to eat now.

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:04.700
Just a little tired.

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:10.460
Oh, no, it's a bit chilly.

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:12.819
Don't be nervous.

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:14.100
You'll freeze like that.

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:16.900
Okay.

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:20.740
See over there.

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:24.020
The sun will come up
from there in a minute.

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:26.060
That mountain.

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:28.940
Have you ever come here before?

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:30.660
Who'd you come with?

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:35.140
On my own.

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:38.260
Back then I was by myself.

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:43.100
When I just came here, I was alone.

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:45.219
I heard that the sunrise is so glorious.

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:46.780
So I came.

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:48.660
Wen Shan.

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:53.940
I have never seen the sunrise.

00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:57.420
Even the moon at night,

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:01.100
I only really saw it after I met you.

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:04.579
You didn't sleep at night.

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:05.900
You'd go out and watch the moon.

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:12.940
So.

00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:16.020
Which one do you prefer...

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:18.300
the rising sun?

00:13:19.312 --> 00:13:21.780
Or the moon at night?

00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:26.140
I don't know.

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:31.620
How about you?

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:35.820
Before this it was the moon.

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:39.460
You had to put a
qualifying time on it, huh.

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:41.620
Yes.

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:44.380
Can I know the reason?

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:47.540
I will not tell you.

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:49.380
It's my secret.

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:51.700
So many secrets.

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:53.419
I need a shoulder to lean on

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:54.580
I'm exhausted.

00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:58.420
Well, you'd better take a rest.

00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:00.660
Once the sun starts coming out,

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:02.740
I will wake you up, okay?

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:04.980
Okay.
