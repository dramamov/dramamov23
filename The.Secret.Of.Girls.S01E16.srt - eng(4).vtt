"The Secret of Girls"
(Episode 16)

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.320
Tired?

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.280
I'm okay now.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.600
Drink some water.

00:03:44.146 --> 00:03:45.146
Be careful.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.320
There's still some time before sunrise.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:54.600
Let's have a rest now.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:56.520
By the way

00:03:56.521 --> 00:03:57.640
I bought some food.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:58.680
Would you like some?

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.440
I am not hungry.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.440
I don't want to eat now.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.720
Just a little tired.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.480
Oh, no, it's a bit chilly.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.839
Don't be so nervous.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.120
You'll freeze like that.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:16.920
Okay.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:20.760
See over there.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.040
The sun will come up
from there in a minute.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.080
That mountain.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.960
Have you ever come here before?

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.680
Who'd you come with?

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.160
On my own.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.280
When I just came here.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:41.840
Back then I was by myself.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.480
When I just came here, I was alone.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.239
I heard that the sunrise is so glorious.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.800
So I came.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.680
Wen Shan.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.960
I have never see the sunrise.

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.440
Even the moon at night,

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.120
I only really saw it after I met you.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.599
You didn't sleep at night.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.920
You'd go out and watch the moon.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:12.960
So.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.040
Which one do you prefer...

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.320
the rising sun?

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.800
Or the moon at night?

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.160
I don't know.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:31.640
How about you?

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.840
Before this it was the moon.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.440
You had to put a
qualifying time on it, huh.

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:41.640
Yes.

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.400
Can I know the reason?

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.560
No, I will not tell you.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.400
It's my secret.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.720
So many secrets.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.439
I need a shoulder to lean on

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.600
I'm exhausted.

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.440
Well, you'd better take a rest.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.680
Once the sun starts coming out,

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.760
I will wake you up, okay?

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Okay.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.040
Wen Shan.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.080
When we get back,

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.520
can you cook noodles for me?

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.960
I haven't eaten the noodles
you make in a long time.

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.440
Didn't you not like them at the start?

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.040
No.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:33.560
I loved it.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.120
Sure, if you like.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.360
I will cook it for you everyday.

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.360
For real?

00:06:43.586 --> 00:06:44.586
Sure.

00:06:44.773 --> 00:06:45.773
It's a deal.

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:52.600
Then I'm looking forward to everyday ahead.

00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.520
Wen Shan.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.480
Is the sun coming out soon?

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.360
Yes, soon.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:07.880
Very soon.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.960
Just wait a minute.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.120
Wen Shan.

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:17.840
Wen Shan.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:24.960
Wen Shan.

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.320
Xu Jingxi.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:24.720
Xu Jingxi gave it to me.

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.600
And reminded me to give you after she left.

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:27.840
So mysterious.

00:08:28.273 --> 00:08:30.753
Perhaps you should open it now?

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:33.680
It's okay.

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:34.680
I know what it is.

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.000
To my dear Wen Shan.

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:42.840
I am sorry.

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.440
When you see this letter,

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.280
I think I will have left already.

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:51.920
Wen Shan.

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.160
I feel so fortunate to have met you.

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:56.920
In the last stretch of my life,

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:58.880
I met you.

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:02.600
You must be confused.

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:04.640
Even resentment.

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.000
Why didn't I tell you?

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:09.640
I want to say.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.640
I am so appreciative that
I had enough time

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.960
to help you open your heart.

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:17.720
Stop, so itchy.

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:19.720
And to embrace the world again.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.480
After I leave, I hope...

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:27.720
You can treat others just
like how you treated me.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.280
You don't need to keep
any resentment or resistance.

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.440
But if you're scared you can't do it,

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:36.040
it's fine.

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.240
I really mean that.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.600
Just be yourself.

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.280
Be happy.

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:43.640
Just be happy.

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:46.720
You once said,

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:48.840
you like the moon the most.

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.840
Since there's no one else around at night,

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.280
The moon belongs only to you.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.280
And yet,

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.760
I want to see the sunrise with you.

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:03.000
I want you to see the sun with me.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.320
I hope you can be like the sun.

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.000
Be passionate.

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:10.440
Be positive.

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.360
I wonder that when you get this letter,

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.440
have we seen the sunrise together?

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.040
If we did,

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:24.000
it must've been beautiful.

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:25.320
Glorious.

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:27.280
Right?

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:32.920
If we didn't make it,

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:34.840
it's also fine.

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:37.360
I will be your moon.

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.040
The moon belongs only to you.

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:47.400
Xu Jingxi.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:18.800
I need to go to the restroom.

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:34.680
Xu Jingxi.

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:42.960
Can I give you a hug?

00:11:50.372 --> 00:11:51.372
When you're with me,

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:53.440
you always can just be yourself.

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.040
Do you hear me?

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:57.400
Yes!

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.680
Pretty?

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:03.240
Xu Jingxi.

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:09.320
The sun is rising.

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:13.400
It's beautiful.

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:19.640
Do you see it?
