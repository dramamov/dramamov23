To think I got blackout drunk.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.570
And on top of that,
with a guy I just met at a bar...

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:27.520
Who are you?

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:29.270
Huh?

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:31.760
But seriously,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.380
he's pretty good-looking.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:35.330
I...

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.440
So I can be with a guy, too, huh?

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:39.500
What are you doing?

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.500
I told you to untie this.

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.210
What you did to me...

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.690
I'm not going to let you pretend it never happened.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.160
But,

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.520
with someone so unreasonable...

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.980
If you're always this forceful,

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.630
you'll never win anyone over.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.460
You'll be alone forever.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.300
Getting drunk,

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:11.390
making a move on someone,

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.350
then waking up the next morning
claiming you don't remember a thing.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.070
No matter how I look at it, this is my fault.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.040
Ikushima.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.210
There's someone downstairs for you.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:28.660
Huh?

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.310
A guy with blond hair.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.660
He said he's here to return something of yours.

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:35.690
Okay.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.200

(Episode 2)

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.630
You forgot your student ID.

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.350
Didn't you even notice...?

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:40.070
Thank you.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.140
Don't mention it.

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:48.940
So then,

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:50.570
this ultimate jerk...

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.740
how am I supposed to make him mine?

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.890
Looks like I can't rely on alcohol for help.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.580
This is going to be tough...

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.050
Your side...

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:02.640
Is it okay now?

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.060
It must hurt.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:05.700
Huh...?

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:06.920
No, it's just...

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.150
I was pretty rough...

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.040
- I told you to stop! Didn't you hear me?
- Shizuma, that hurts!

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:16.740
Ah.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.350
It hurts.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.270
It probably still hurts a little.

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:23.790
Let me see.

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:28.550
I'm just kidding.

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.220
Why would you do that?

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:33.820
Would you have worried about me otherwise?

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.520
That's not it.

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.970
What happened this morning was really my fault.

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.390
Not only did I get blackout drunk,

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.350
but I also did something so terrible to you...

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:50.420
Let's sit here.

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:52.510
Here.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:58.560
So cute.

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.020
So...

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.180
that thing he's chewing on...

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.300
Could that be... your ex-girlfriend?

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:10.380
Yuka?

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.320
Yeah.

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.030
Hey.

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.390
Are you still mad at her?

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.880
If I said I'm not mad at all,

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:26.630
that would be a total lie.

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.090
But when I see her face,

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.260
I'm at a loss for words.

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:45.790
Oh! Shizuma!

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:47.490
You're alive!

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:48.770
I'm alive.

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:49.890
Cut it out!

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.810
You're the one who ditched me.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.460
Alright, alright.

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.190
Is that the guy who was with Shizuma yesterday?

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.040
Stay out of this.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.530
Hey! Wait a minute,

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.170
you're the guy from the bar yesterday, aren't you?

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:04.950
Why are you here?

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.690
I'm just here to return something to him.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:09.260
Oh really?

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.350
For real?

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.100
Isn't that Yuka?

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.730
She's just as cute as I thought!

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.970
I can't believe Shizuma was dating a girl like that.

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:25.970
How rude can you guys be?

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.430
But no matter how cute she is, cheating is not okay.

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:30.440
She was so clingy with Shizuma before.

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.060
Where did all that love go?

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.140
This is what I'm talking about.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.380
Where were you during first period today?

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:45.490
I had a massive hangover.

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:47.590
Look,

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.180
We know you're not gay,
so we don't care.

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:53.180
But if rumors start spreading
that you got dumped by a woman,

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:55.600
and then went running to a guy,
what are you gonna do?

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.510
You should be more careful about
who you hang out with, okay?

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.160
And you.

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:06.230
If you're hitting on Shizuma
with those kinds of intentions,

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.160
please stop...

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:15.810
Enough, I'm telling you.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.060
Huh? Me?

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.770
Anyone who doesn't respect others...

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.070
can't be my friend.

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:33.330
Let's go.

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:34.330
Ah, okay...

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:42.110
Hey! Shizuma!

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:52.370
Sorry.

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:54.180
You had to go through that.

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.060
It's nothing.

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:58.760
I'm used to it.

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.610
But this is the first time
someone's ever stood up for me like that.

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:04.830
Thanks.

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:10.070
But,

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:13.750
this morning, I wasn't any different
from them, was I...?

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:19.800
I'm sorry!

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:22.430
I even said you'd be alone forever.

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:24.120
That was way out of line.

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:27.540
He apologized just like that...!

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:30.220
Well...

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:35.190
You're saying I came on to you first?

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:38.010
What happened?

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:47.490
You did something that made me really happy.

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:51.130
It was the first time I'd ever felt that way.

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:53.600
Felt what way...?

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:55.950
What are you going to do after you hear it?

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:57.220
What do you think...?

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.200
What do you think...?

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.000
I'll take responsibility, of course!

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:06.460
Responsibility!

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.090
You're so serious.

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:15.860
Then,

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:18.160
how are you going to take responsibility?

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:21.070
Well...

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.220
Anything within my power.

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:26.290
Anything at all.

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:31.510
Then,

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:33.150
come with me.

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:37.710
Let's go.

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:48.990
You're...

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:51.090
not mad anymore?

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:52.840
Yeah.

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:55.590
Because you gave me a proper apology, Shizuma.

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:02.720
As if I'd forgive you that easily.

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:04.890
Hey.

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:07.420
You said anything within your power.

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:09.020
Are there any limits?

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Well...

00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:15.790
I hadn't really thought about it.

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:18.420
Then,

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:20.050
can I decide for you?

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:21.510
Huh...?

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:24.620
The extent of Shizuma's power...

00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:26.380
I'll figure it out for you.

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:32.250
Up to here?

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:39.880
Up to here?

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:45.240
Then,

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.560
is this okay?

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.350
Or maybe...

00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:54.010
Wait.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:56.650
Um... It's not that I don't like this.

00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:59.270
And of course I'll take responsibility.

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:03.540
It's just that, right here...

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:06.080
You're overthinking it.

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:09.500
You're lonely because Yuka left you.

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:11.550
I just want to comfort you a little.

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:16.580
Trust me.

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:40.780
Whenever you're lonely and sad, come find me.

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:45.120
I'll be waiting for you.

00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:05.770
What's wrong?

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:10.050
Um,

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:13.500
I know we just started dating,

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:15.500
but,

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:17.220
I...

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:20.430
want to know more about you, Itsuki.

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:23.940
Yeah.

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:27.520
That dangerous job

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:29.820
you used to have...
what was it, exactly?

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:36.290
You're not in any danger

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:39.260
anymore, are you?

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:57.350
Whenever you're lonely and sad, come find me.

00:11:58.180 --> 00:11:59.180
I'll be waiting for you.

00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:21.020
So, shall we go in?

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:24.520
I'm prepared for anything.

00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:31.490
Why?

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:40.290
Itsuki, don't worry.

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:43.420
No matter what happens, I'll protect you.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:45.160
Okay.

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:49.120
Yumi, do you like Kyo-chan or Ru-chan better?

00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:51.530
Huh? I have no idea. I'm not interested.

00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:55.430
It feels kinda...

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:56.900
peaceful in here...

00:12:57.790 --> 00:12:58.790
You're right.

00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:02.110
I thought...

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:04.760
it was a yakuza-run bar...

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:07.820
Oh my.

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:09.870
Itsuki-chan, long time no see.

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:13.100
Could this be Itsuki-chan's new boyfriend?

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:15.130
Yes, this is Shohei.

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:17.210
You caught a cute one.

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:19.860
Just what I'd expect from Itsuki-chan.
You two look good together.

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:25.190
This is a respectable LGBTQ+ bar.

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:28.870
People of all different gender identities
and sexual orientations work here.

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:30.300
However...

00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:33.110
we occasionally get some creeps in here.

00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:36.020
That's why I'm here as security,
to handle those situations.

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:40.520
Then why did Minato-san tell me...

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:42.040
that it was a dangerous job?

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:45.000
Because if I said that...

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:48.660
You might have run away from me, Shohei.

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:50.290
What?

00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:59.430
No matter how much you hate me, Minato-san,

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:02.110
I will never, ever break up with Itsuki-san.

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:05.500
You know, kid...

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:07.560
you've got more guts than I thought.

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:15.420
Mama-san.

00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:17.650
Thanks.

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:20.960
Come again soon.

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:24.850
Bye-bye.

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:33.940
Minato...

00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:38.290
Did he just...

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:40.110
accept me?

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:46.470
Staring at me like that is kind of annoying.

00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:48.010
It's because I like you...

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:52.840
Isn't it obvious? I always make
a fabulous entrance.

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.450
I'm Hanako.

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:56.840
As you can see...

00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:58.320
I'm a drag queen.

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:00.590
My name is Asuka.

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:03.060
I'm an MtF transgender woman.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:06.110
Everyone calls me Ken-chan. I'm bisexual.

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:07.320
And for the record, I'm terminally single.

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:10.370
See? That's exactly why you're single.
You're always saying stuff like that.

00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:12.760
So it's true, I'm doomed to be single!

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:17.710
This is my first time in a place like this.
I'm really moved.

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:18.840
Thank you.

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:21.260
We're happy to have you too, Sho-chan.

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:24.760
I think of Itsuki-chan as my own son.

00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:26.420
So from now on, Sho-chan...

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:27.880
you're my son too.

00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:29.880
Okay. I'm so happy.

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:35.780
This is my first time meeting you, right, Asuka?

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:38.200
How long have you been working here?

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:41.600
I started three months ago.

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:46.230
I'm working here while I go to college.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:47.720
I see.

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:49.610
Keep up the good work!

00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:51.170
Thank you.

00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:53.900
Itsuki-san...

00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:56.020
You and Minato-san are brothers, right?

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:57.300
Yeah.

00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:59.350
He's my handful of a little brother.

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:02.420
You're both so handsome.

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:03.780
It's just perfect!

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:08.740
But, as amazing as Minato-san is,
winning over a straight guy is...

00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:12.590
What are you talking about?

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:16.160
Oh, shoot. You didn't know?

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:20.830
Minato-san is trying to win over
a straight guy he met here.

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:22.760
We even have a bet going.

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:24.840
A bet?

00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:29.050
But that "straight" guy
seems a little bent himself...

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:40.290
You're lonely because Yuka left you.

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:42.230
I just wanted to comfort you a little.

00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:48.510
He was so angry at first...

00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:50.660
Why did he have a change of heart?

00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:52.580
I'll be waiting for you.

00:16:56.610 --> 00:16:58.370
He turned and left so easily...

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:00.170
but for some reason, it left me feeling empty.

00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:04.540
It was the first time I'd ever felt
such a powerful attraction to a man.

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:13.660
I'm home~

00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:15.580
Welcome back...

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:17.250
Whew.

00:17:21.610 --> 00:17:22.610
Big bro...

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:25.410
What are you spacing out for?

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:26.420
What's wrong?

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:32.490
Shohei...

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:35.200
This is just a hypothetical,

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:37.350
but if you felt for a man...

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:39.570
a heart-pounding feeling
like you've never felt before...

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:41.020
what would you do?

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:42.990
Huh?

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:45.250
What would I do...

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:47.500
I don't see anything wrong with that.

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:50.310
I'd just think, "This is great."
"I like him."

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:51.900
You should just be honest
with yourself and accept those feelings.

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:55.260
I see...

00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:57.450
You're right...

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:18.320
Shizuma!

00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:23.570
- Yuka... What is it?
- Well... this is for you.

00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:30.970
Thank you for taking me out every year for my birthday.

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:34.000
We can't go this year,
so I wanted to give this to you.

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:36.960
Oh, that's right.

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:39.730
Sorry for waiting until the last minute!

00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:41.930
You can go with a friend.

00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:44.410
Yeah.

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:45.880
I'll get going then.

00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:53.970
How pathetic.

00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:56.670
Go apologize.

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:01.860
If you're ever lonely or sad, just call me.

00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:03.650
Oh.

00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:05.860
Go apologize already... Ah!

00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:08.390
Shizuma.

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:20.600
Enough.

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:22.200
I prefer Minato.

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:24.250
Minato~

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:25.400
Hey.

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:28.800
You've been staring at your phone this whole time.

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:32.110
Did you finally find a guy you like?

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:34.750
Huh...

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:35.820
For real?

00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:37.960
Has spring finally sprung for Minato-chan?

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:39.320
It's not like that.

00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:42.970
It's just a bet with the guys from Gambit
about whether I could win over a straight guy.

00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:45.090
It's just to kill time.

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:47.420
Ooh~

00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:52.610
- Well, if you get dumped, I'll be here for you.
- Me too.

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:54.410
I'm going to grab something.

00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:00.300
- He's not mad, is he?
- Jeez, why would he be?

00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:15.430
Shizuma?

00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:16.670
Ah.

00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:17.670
Minato.

00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:21.030
Sorry this is so sudden...

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:23.590
Are you free this weekend?

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:26.820
Are you asking me...

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:28.330
to go on an overnight trip?

00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:29.790
Yeah.

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:32.450
The place I booked for Yuka's birthday...

00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:34.700
it'd be weird to go alone...

00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:37.090
Hmm...

00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:40.720
Ask me in a cuter way,
and maybe I'll make time for you.

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:46.980
Hmm~?

00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:54.650
I want to go with you!

00:20:56.030 --> 00:20:57.230
Please come with me.

00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:02.690
I guess I can't say no to that.

00:21:03.410 --> 00:21:04.830
Where are you taking me?

00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:26.960
Laughters, so full of joy...

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:30.020
The smiles, brimming with happiness.

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:32.190
Smile.

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:34.180
Smile.

00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:35.840
Smile.

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:41.180
This is pure hell.

00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:31.600
(Next Episode)
I think...

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:34.440
this might be the happiest I've ever been in my life.

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:37.120
I'll never forget you again.

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:38.100
So, how was it?

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:41.310
After today, Shizuma might actually change.

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:42.560
What is this...

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:44.140
What is it that I want him to say to me?
