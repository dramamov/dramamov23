[Whispers of Fate]

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.930
[Episode 20]

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.910
You want the rights of the Sword Alliance

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.910
yet refuse to abide by its rules.

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.840
That's something we cannot agree to.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.710
Are you two implying

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:38.950
that either

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:40.200
I am

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.950
unworthy of serving
as the Alliance's Guest of Honor

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:43.710
or that

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.420
the Sword Alliance itself

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.050
is unworthy of having
a Guest of Honor at all?

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.950
Ever since Mr. Tang entered the jianghu,

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:55.710
his every deed

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:56.990
has proven his worth—

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.990
skilled in martial arts

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.190
and unmatched in wit.

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:00.840
If we reject him now,

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:02.000
it would make us seem

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000
narrow-minded,

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.300
unable to tolerate a rising talent.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:06.510
But Mr. Tang,
you've always ignored the rules

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.240
and gone wherever you pleased.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.229
You now suddenly wish
to join the Sword Alliance,

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.150
claiming to serve
for the peace in the jianghu.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.880
Doesn't that seem suspicious?

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.230
If I were to join the Alliance

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.000
with no desire or ambition,

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.570
willingly serving beneath others,

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.370
wouldn't that be even stranger?

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.000
Since I wish
to serve as the Guest of Honor,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.030
you sword masters should

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.470
feel reassured instead.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.280
Doesn't that precisely show

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:31.550
that I am willing

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.329
to take on responsibility

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:34.660
for the Sword Alliance?

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.690
The Fengliu Shop has already thrown
the jianghu into chaos.

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:38.750
Now more than ever,

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.460
the Sword Alliance
must not fall into disorder.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.470
We cannot accept

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.250
an uncontrollable and dangerous man.

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:44.090
So,

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.110
what you guys mean is,

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:48.990
the current Sword Alliance

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.030
doesn't need any change

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.120
to stand against the Fengliu Shop?

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.040
Is that right?

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.360
I understand now.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:58.770
In their understanding,

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:59.560
the greater the power,

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.890
the greater the danger.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.220
I believe

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:03.610
everyone here

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.190
has the resolve to fight

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.850
the Fengliu Shop to the death.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.110
But if resolve alone were enough,

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.000
would the Sword Alliance

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.630
still be so disorganized?

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.520
If all of you could win

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:17.950
by risking your lives,

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:18.900
then Master Shao

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:19.720
wouldn't have

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.720
let me, Tang Lici, stand here today.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:22.920
What did you just say?

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.329
The Fengliu Shop isn't a gang
of petty thieves,

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:30.590
nor mountain bandits.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:31.750
They have not only

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.740
the ambition
to plunge the world into chaos

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.810
but also endless cunning schemes.

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.320
The enemy is advancing fiercely—
but the Sword Alliance?

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.180
Still clinging to old rules
and refusing to change.

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.370
Isn't that asking for destruction?

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:45.430
Mr. Tang,

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:46.530
that's nonsense!

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:47.340
Master Xiao,

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.120
what the Alliance needs now

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.490
is not caution,

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.670
but change.

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:51.890
Only if I join

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.020
will there be a sliver of hope.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.870
If you don't even have the courage

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.000
to accept me,

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.260
how could you speak of

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.930
having the courage
to fight the Fengliu Shop?

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.590
Since you are courting death,

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:03.910
what difference is there

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.110
between dying sooner

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.820
and dying later?

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:08.150
Stop talking nonsense.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.810
Or perhaps—

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:10.150
you fear me…

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.130
more than you fear Liu Yan?

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:15.590
We don't fear you!

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:17.630
Everyone, calm down.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.430
Mr. Tang truly is

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.200
sharp-witted and quick-tongued.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.240
The six of us

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.080
cannot out-argue you alone.

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:29.170
However,

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.340
your appointment
as the Guest of Honor

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.330
is a matter of great importance.

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.380
According to the Sword Alliance's rules
of procedure,

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:38.150
the six of us initiated a vote.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:39.670
[Tang Lici's appointment
as the Guest of Honor]

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:40.000
[requires the Ancestor's approval,
or it cannot proceed.]

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.040
So today,

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:42.990
we're not here to debate with you—

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.070
just to inform you of the result.

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:50.950
What does that mean?

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:52.710
It means

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.140
with this voting result in hand,

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.310
Master Shao's decision no longer counts.

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:00.070
Unless

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.240
you can somehow overturn

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.430
the rules laid down

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:03.790
by the Ancestor.

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:06.980
They call themselves righteous,

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:08.660
yet they're so shameless.

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:10.120
But that's fine,

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:11.360
not a problem at all.

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:12.790
Foxy Tang,

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.100
if this place won't have you,

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.390
you can always
find somewhere else that will.

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.920
Let's go.

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:18.030
Wait a moment.

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:35.770
Master Puzhu.

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.950
You came to…

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:43.400
I heard Mr. Tang arrived
at the Sword Alliance,

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.659
so I came immediately.

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:46.310
Master Puzhu,

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.140
are you here
to have me honor our agreement now?

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:49.500
You once promised me

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.450
that once you reached the Sword Alliance,

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:52.450
you'd fight me

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.720
in Qingyang Realm.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:55.070
No time

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:56.720
like the present.

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:05.920
Before we begin,

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.530
I'd like to know,

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:08.910
Master Puzhu, whether you too

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:10.170
are unwilling to see me

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:12.180
take the seat of Guest of Honor?

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:13.680
You do things without regard

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.610
for convention.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.970
Forgive me, but I cannot condone that.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:21.950
It seems

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.200
you've misunderstood me.

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.140
A misunderstanding

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.400
should be cleared up.

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:30.150
We'll talk after the fight.

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:34.720
Everyone,

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:36.510
once the duel is decided,

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.820
I'll personally see Mr. Tang off.

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:40.040
Then,

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:42.720
I won't disturb your meeting any further.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:43.250
Let's go.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.070
Mr. Tang and Master Puzhu

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:53.430
are dueling in Qingyang Realm!

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:54.690
Hurry, let's go watch!

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.360
Is it really that fox spirit,

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.159
Mr. Tang Lici?

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:58.960
Is he really as powerful
as the rumors say?

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.070
Go see for yourself!

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:00.600
Let's go!

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.970
[The Peak of Heaven]

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:14.530
[Qingyang Realm]

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:21.440
Why fight in Qingyang Realm?

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:22.540
Is there some special reason?

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:24.080
Probably to make it seem more formal.

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:25.720
Long ago, Ancestor Zhao Quanyang

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.760
held the Central Plains
Martial Arts Tournament here,

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.090
creating six divine swords

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:31.160
and entrusting them
to six masters of their era.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.030
That was the origin of the Sword Alliance.

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:35.020
It's said that when the Ancestor ascended
in broad daylight,

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:36.810
his sword energy filled heaven and earth,

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:38.500
summoning a golden dragon from the skies.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.560
Then he rode the dragon and ascended.

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:42.190
Stop right there.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.730
We take those tales as stories.

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:45.770
You actually believe them?

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:46.630
Of course we do.

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:48.830
Every disciple of the Sword Alliance

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:50.430
honors the Ancestor deeply.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:53.510
Mr. Tang,

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:55.120
please.

♪ Mad and laughing

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:52.120

when the Ancestor transcended

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:54.000
the Broken Void Realm.

Rise!

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:52.330
Yesterday,

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:54.190
the Ancestor appeared in my dream.

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:55.790
I didn't believe it at first.

00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:58.760
So I came today to study the Sword Wall

00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:00.420
and to

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.720
seek the Ancestor's confirmation.

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.640
What is it you wish to confirm,
Master Shao?

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:07.640
Ancestor Zhao said

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:09.770
that the Sword Alliance

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:11.170
will soon welcome a man

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:13.360
blessed with both wisdom and valor.

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:17.110
He shall help the martial arts world
through its greatest trial,

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:20.030
restoring peace to the jianghu.

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:24.070
And now, it seems…

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:48.630
Shen,

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:50.840
I recall someone saying earlier

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:54.040
that unless the rules set by the Ancestor
are overturned…

00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:55.890
Does this count as his approval?

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:57.140
If not,

00:11:57.170 --> 00:11:59.370
wouldn't that be defying the Ancestor?

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:20.270
We have an honored guest.

00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:40.660
[Imperial]

00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:56.420
I didn't know you would be visiting.

00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:58.620
Forgive me for not greeting you sooner.

00:12:58.780 --> 00:12:59.510
Master Shao,

00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:01.210
Mount Cloud truly lives up

00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:03.470
to its name
as one of the Central Plains' finest.

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:05.130
As I stood at the bow of my boat,

00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:07.890
I saw a golden dragon
holding the sun in its jaws

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.150
and radiant clouds flowing endlessly.

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:11.810
It was truly a wondrous sight.

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:14.370
Such scenes don't appear every day.

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:16.280
It's only because the Ancestor
revealed his spirit today

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:18.010
that such a spectacle was seen.

00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:20.110
I'll be honest with you.

00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:22.400
Even I was witnessing it
for the first time.

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:23.070
Is that so?

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:24.490
Master Shao,

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:27.770
why did the Sword Alliance's ancestor

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:29.470
manifest himself today?

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.100
Perhaps the Ancestor had something

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:37.310
he wished to tell us.

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:39.720
But we are too dull of mind

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:41.320
to comprehend it yet.

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:47.010
Your personal visit to the Sword Alliance

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:48.350
shows how seriously
His Majesty regards this matter.

00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:50.200
Since it concerns Yique Yinyang,

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:52.200
we certainly can't take it lightly.

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:53.660
However, Master Shao,

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:55.630
I came today

00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:57.690
bearing a message

00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:59.200
from His Majesty.

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:08.940
By royal command:

00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:11.440
From this day forth,

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:13.000
the Sword Alliance's campaign
against the Fengliu Shop

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.010
shall have all the weapons
and armor it needs

00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:17.140
fully supplied by the imperial court.

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:20.040
3,000 armored soldiers
will be dispatched in support,

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:22.520
along with 50,000 taels of gold,

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:27.500
to ensure the complete annihilation
of the Fengliu Shop.

00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:30.570
-We're grateful to His Majesty.
-We're grateful to His Majesty.

00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:30.980
Please,

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:31.840
take your seat.

00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:35.250
50,000 taels—so much!

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:36.580
This is wonderful news.

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:39.630
Where's Lici?

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:41.790
I rushed here

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:43.520
because I received his letter.

00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:04.430
Godfather.

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:07.630
We were just talking about you.

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:09.380
Why were you hiding out here?

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:11.310
I've been looking all over for you.

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:13.690
You've joined the Sword Alliance,

00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:15.590
and that makes me truly happy.

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:17.390
With you here, I can rest easy.

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:18.600
And I believe His Majesty

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.000
will be relieved as well.

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:21.630
Actually, I haven't yet…

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:24.080
Mr. Tang's appointment
as the Guest of Honor

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:25.550
of the Sword Alliance

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:27.310
is a blessing for us all.

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:30.920
Don't you agree, everyone?

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:34.520
Yes.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:35.720
Yes.

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:39.440
Mr. Tang,

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:40.730
please.

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:50.550
Foxy Tang

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:52.390
brought the imperial court in
as his backing.

00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:53.440
Now those old sword masters

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:55.370
won't be able to object, will they?

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:07.360
Tang Sen?

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:09.320
What's he doing here?

00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:13.600
Master Shao,

00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:16.860
seeing how united the Sword Alliance is,

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:19.030
I don't think the Fengliu Shop
is much of a threat.

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:19.570
Indeed.

00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:21.830
Lici,

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:24.170
the thing you asked me to bring—

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:25.840
I've brought it.

00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:27.250
Thank you, Godfather.

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:29.750
Today,

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:30.840
while my godfather,

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:31.970
Master Shao,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.850
and all the sword masters are present,

00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:35.730
I have an announcement to make.

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:37.970
Please, Mr. Tang, go ahead.

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:42.150
Today,

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:45.130
as the Master of Wanqiao Chamber,

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:46.640
I have decided

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:49.600
to donate 100,000 taels of gold

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:53.110
to fund the fight
against the Fengliu Shop.

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:06.000
This 100,000 taels of gold

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:07.339
will be distributed only to

00:17:07.339 --> 00:17:09.930
the warriors
who stand against the Fengliu Shop.

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:11.210
Any sect willing

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:13.170
to aid in the campaign against them

00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:14.920
and submit to unified command

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:17.069
may register their names.

00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:18.930
Shen,

00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:19.750
Foxy Tang

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:22.310
is donating so much money
to the Sword Alliance.

00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:23.750
So much gold!

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:26.069
Should anyone die

00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:27.000
fighting the Fengliu Shop,

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.380
50 taels will be paid as compensation.

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:29.890
All other expenses
for rations and supplies

00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:31.550
will also come from this fund.

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:33.950
Once the Fengliu Shop is destroyed,

00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:35.360
any remaining balance

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:39.150
will be managed by the Sword Alliance

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:41.110
and equally distributed among

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:43.640
the sect disciples
registered on the roster.

00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:47.240
Master of Wanqiao Chamber,
thank you for being so generous.

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:50.570
Master of Wanqiao Chamber,
thank you for being so generous.

00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:55.470
Since I've come

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:58.300
to the Sword Alliance
as the Guest of Honor,

00:17:58.400 --> 00:17:59.890
the Alliance's affairs

00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:01.180
are now mine as well.

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:03.830
Any building in need of repair,

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:06.350
any materials that must be replenished,

00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:07.440
whether it's

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:08.750
provisions,

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:10.000
weapons,

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:11.630
or medicine,

00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:13.690
I will do my utmost to provide.

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:14.900
Excellent!

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:16.140
Since

00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:18.090
Mr. Tang is so righteous and generous,

00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:18.950
I propose

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:21.340
we hold a banquet
at Mount Cloud tonight

00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:22.680
and drink heartily

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:23.740
with Mr. Tang.

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:25.290
Let's drink our grudges away!

00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:26.350
What do you all say?

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:36.350
What do you think?

00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:37.330
Good idea!

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:41.080
Good idea!

00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:44.880
Mr. Tang?

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:46.220
Good idea.

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:48.550
It would be my honor.

00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:50.220
Then tonight,

00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:53.440
I shall not leave until we're all drunk.

00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:56.410
Let's drink our grudges away.

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:01.430
Chi, Shen,

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:03.580
the view here is nice, isn't it?

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:05.810
Mr. Tang,

00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:06.940
my arrangements this time—

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:08.340
were they satisfactory?

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:11.040
Master Shao, your arrangements

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:13.090
were truly beyond my expectations.

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:15.880
You've seen
the Sword Alliance's current state.

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:17.110
If I were to suppress dissent by force,

00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:18.370
those opposing voices

00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:19.960
would only grow stronger.

00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:21.330
So I had to invite you

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:22.830
to appear at this exact moment.

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:25.290
A day earlier or later
wouldn't have worked.

00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:32.430
So you faked

00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:34.770
the Ancestor's manifestation, huh?

00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:36.200
Keep your voice down.

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:37.310
That 100,000 taels of gold

00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:38.160
came from him.

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:38.560
Right.

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:41.790
When Mr. Tang touched the Sword Wall,

00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:43.750
sword energy truly
burst forth from within.

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:45.810
You couldn't fake something that real.

00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:46.880
Exactly.

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:48.880
The sword energy in Qingyang Realm

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:50.440
builds up over every 60 years.

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:51.640
When struck by an outside force,

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:52.830
it releases powerful phenomena.

00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:55.550
It's like water overflowing
when the vessel is full.

00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:57.350
How could that possibly be fake?

00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:58.840
I see now.

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.120
So it had to be today.

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:05.030
There's still one thing
I don't understand.

00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:06.240
Master Puzhu—

00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:08.500
why is he willing to help us?

00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:11.930
Because you're not as sly
as he thought you were,

00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:13.640
and he's not as rigid
as you thought he was.

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:14.790
With Master Puzhu on our side,

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:15.740
now,

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:18.610
no one will dare provoke you again.

00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:20.920
-Please.
-Please.

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:22.400
We're almost there.

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:23.030
Up ahead.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:24.550
This way.

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:33.810
Mr. Tang,

00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:34.830
Shen,

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:35.660
Chi,

00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:37.080
you're here.

00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:46.110
Who stacked these stones?

00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:47.430
They look quite nice.

00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:49.660
Chi, don't!

00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:56.200
Stone.

00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:58.540
–Stone, stop!
–Stop!

00:21:06.050 --> 00:21:06.980
You're so young,

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:09.020
but you sure have incredible strength.

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:09.830
Do you realize

00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:12.650
you could've killed someone doing that?

00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:20.460
Cloud, look at you,

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:22.670
beaten by a kid.

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:26.320
He caught me off guard,
and I didn't dodge.

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:28.150
He was born with incredible strength.

00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:29.600
But he has a bad temper.

00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:30.780
That's how Stone is.

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:32.330
He doesn't talk much

00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:34.950
and spends his days stacking stones,

00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:36.680
then knocking them down again.

00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:38.570
Exceptional physique.

00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:40.510
Born with incredible strength.

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:42.190
And his movements are agile.

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:43.450
Master Shao.

00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:45.320
Whose disciple is he?

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:46.830
You've seen what he's like.

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:48.310
With that temperament of his,

00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:49.680
even if someone likes him,

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:50.510
they'll end up

00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:52.310
having to back away eventually.

00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:53.900
Alright, enough about that.

00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:55.560
Stone is withdrawn by nature.

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:57.180
If you want to approach him,

00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:58.750
you'll have to humble yourself first

00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:00.030
to lower his guard.

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:01.350
And also—

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:03.570
don't touch his stones.

00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:06.230
That way, he won't see you as a threat.

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:14.400
Miss Shei,

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:17.650
you've only been here a few days,
haven't you?

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:18.830
Yet you've already figured out

00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:20.360
how that young man behaves.

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:23.120
Because he's simple-minded too.

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:25.660
Let's go.

00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:27.290
When no one's around,

00:22:27.410 --> 00:22:28.540
he'll show himself.

00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:29.920
Mr. Tang,

00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:30.830
let's go.

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:31.810
This way.

00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:32.890
Be careful.

00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:34.320
Don't touch the stones.

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:35.480
This way, please.

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:42.590
Tingyun Pavilion—

00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:44.720
sounds suspiciously like

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:46.310
somewhere I should live.

00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:47.830
Foxy Tang is so lucky.

00:22:49.090 --> 00:22:50.090
What do you think?

00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:51.090
Beautiful.

00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:53.320
I'm talking about the crane.

00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:55.960
Plump.

00:22:58.200 --> 00:22:59.000
Shame though…

00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:02.090
Shame that one pot's too small
to stew it whole.

00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:03.460
Senior Xue?

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:07.030
Why didn't you give me a heads-up?

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:07.920
You can't beat a child,

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:09.780
and now you get scared easily too.

00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:11.830
What brings you here?

00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:14.030
I was just passing by,

00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:15.980
but then I heard someone's been
hauling boxes upon boxes

00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:17.780
of gold into the Sword Alliance.

00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:21.000
So I came to join the fun.

00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:23.360
Not to take a few ingots?

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:25.130
What nonsense is that?

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:26.420
Only a few ingots? Are you kidding me?

00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:27.500
If I make a move,

00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:29.050
I'll take boxes of it.

00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:32.620
Anyway, pure coincidence.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:33.460
Tell me—

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:34.880
where's that fox?

00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:38.240
At Wenxin Lake.

00:23:56.610 --> 00:23:58.440
Have you come up to Mount Cloud

00:23:58.470 --> 00:23:59.640
to freeload?

00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:02.790
Watch your mouth!

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:05.200
Don't you have anything good to say?

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:06.750
What's with that lack of spirit?

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:08.950
Haven't recovered from your injuries?

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.130
I'm in good spirits.

00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:12.070
You're mistaken, Senior Xue.

00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:13.750
Fine.

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:15.440
But there's one thing

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:16.610
I'm not mistaken about.

00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:17.790
Countless jars of aged wine

00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:19.570
have been brought out

00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:21.390
of the Sword Alliance's cellar.

00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:22.260
I've heard

00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:25.870
Mr. Tang is going to drink
with the sword masters.

00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:28.940
I'm new here,

00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:31.770
and drinking is how people get acquainted.

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:32.830
So how many people

00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:34.390
are you planning to get acquainted with?

00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:35.450
Wine is a tricky thing—

00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:36.620
just enough is medicine;

00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:38.290
too much is poison.

00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:39.920
There are so many sword masters
in the Alliance.

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:41.200
They'll take turns drinking with you.

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.160
With your limited inner strength,

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:43.760
how much wine can you handle?

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:46.050
Throwing up would only be embarrassing;

00:24:46.050 --> 00:24:48.840
drinking too much and harming yourself
is the real concern.

00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:49.700
How about this?

00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:52.570
Give me this much money,

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:53.440
and tonight,

00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:55.070
I'll be your drinking buddy

00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:56.440
and take half the drinks for you.

00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:57.260
Think about it—

00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:58.480
once the drinking starts for real,

00:24:58.480 --> 00:24:59.440
all kinds of riffraff

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:00.590
will take advantage of the situation

00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:01.400
and toast you.

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:02.920
Senior Xue, aren't you doing the same—

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:04.920
taking advantage of the situation?

00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:08.160
I'm offering you help.

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:09.590
I don't want to see someone your age

00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:10.920
drink himself to death.

00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:14.010
I'm already giving you
the friendship rate.

00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:14.770
Think about it.

00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:16.240
The wines they'll bring to you

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:17.480
are all homemade and strong.

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:18.720
Who knows what they've put in them?

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:20.440
Snakes, bugs, even mice maybe.

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:21.880
Even if you're perfectly healthy,

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:23.680
you still can't drink that much.

00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:31.880
If I can't handle it,

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:34.700
you think you can, Senior Xue?

00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:36.960
Of course…

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:39.700
Of course I can't drink that much either.

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:42.230
But I know when to act smart.

00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:43.240
How about this?

00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:44.810
We work together

00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:48.120
and burn all the wine before the banquet.

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:49.750
What do you think?

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:53.910
Soon after I arrived
at the Sword Alliance,

00:25:53.910 --> 00:25:55.470
it caught fire?

00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:58.060
That sounds ominous, don't you think?

00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:01.350
I'd say let's forget that.

00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:07.000
Mr. Tang,

00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:08.530
the banquet is ready.

00:26:08.550 --> 00:26:10.710
The sword masters ask
when you'll join them.

00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:11.840
I'll be right there.

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:16.240
In truth,

00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:19.990
reorganizing the Sword Alliance

00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:22.170
isn't that urgent.

00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:23.850
But

00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:26.600
the Fengliu Shop won't see it that way.

00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:35.680
Such a clever man,

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:38.060
yet always doing foolish things.

00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:10.130
-Greetings, Mr. Tang.
-Greetings, Mr. Tang.

00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:12.060
Everyone, please take your seats.

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:18.800
Everyone,

00:27:19.150 --> 00:27:20.970
let us thank Mr. Tang's Wanqiao Chamber

00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:22.430
for its generous support.

00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:24.920
Let's all toast to him!

00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:26.200
Mr. Tang.

00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:30.880
Mr. Tang,

00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:31.730
please.

00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:33.680
Here is

00:27:34.550 --> 00:27:35.550
a toast to you all.

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:40.450
I never thought Mr. Tang

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:41.550
could get along so well

00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:42.410
with everyone.

00:27:42.770 --> 00:27:43.420
How naive.

00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:48.000
When Foxy Tang sets his mind
to charm people,

00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:49.800
no one will dislike him.

00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:00.300
This wine's too mild.

00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:02.680
This is the wine Mr. Tang

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:04.550
brought from the Wanqiao Chamber.

00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:05.640
It's good, sure,

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:06.400
but

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:07.680
the Sword Alliance

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:08.880
has its own wine.

00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:10.380
I wonder if Mr. Tang

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:11.530
dares to try it?

00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:15.920
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:16.720
Tonight,

00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:19.100
whatever wine you bring me,

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:21.370
I'll drink it.

00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:23.730
Switch to big bowls!

00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:25.640
Mr. Tang said that

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:26.510
himself.

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:27.900
You all heard him.

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:29.860
Bring the wine!

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:55.310
Mr. Tang came from afar as a guest.

00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:56.220
He's new here,

00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:58.610
so we shouldn't gang up on him.

00:28:58.990 --> 00:29:00.590
Every time he drinks one bowl of wine,

00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:01.640
two from our side

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:02.830
will drink two bowls each.

00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:03.640
Mr. Tang,

00:29:03.850 --> 00:29:05.400
does that sound fair?

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:10.570
How is that fair?

00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:15.250
So many of you against him alone—

00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:19.060
you call that not ganging up on him?

00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:25.830
Actually, I find it quite fair.

00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:28.840
Can't you see I'm helping you?

00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:30.060
Fine then.

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:34.520
Let me be the first to toast Mr. Tang.

00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:39.480
Mr. Tang,

00:29:39.790 --> 00:29:41.850
that bowl of wine is no ordinary wine.

00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:42.590
That's my

00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:44.250
20-year-old snake bile wine.

00:29:47.250 --> 00:29:48.180
It smells awful.

00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:50.160
Who'd drink that?

00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:57.530
She's toasting me.

00:29:57.840 --> 00:29:59.300
What's it got to do with you?

00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:00.010
You…

00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:03.830
Drink it.

00:30:04.050 --> 00:30:05.650
I'd be happy if it killed you.

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:08.010
Chi.

00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:20.690
Mr. Tang.

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:23.270
Mr. Tang.

00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:24.960
Please.

00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:51.000
Great.

00:30:51.410 --> 00:30:53.150
Try my wine, Mr. Tang.

00:31:00.270 --> 00:31:02.830
Such skill! He didn't spill a single drop.

00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:05.550
Few can match his spirit.

00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:06.340
Indeed.

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:08.020
I thought
he was just throwing his weight around,

00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:09.440
but he truly has

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:11.480
both strength and character.

00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:13.270
Wine reveals one's true nature.

00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:14.160
With such spirit,

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:15.680
the title of Guest of Honor
suits him well.

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:16.350
Mr. Tang.

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:45.000
Impressive tolerance, Mr. Tang.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:45.510
But

00:31:45.930 --> 00:31:46.990
drinking like this

00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:48.400
still isn't satisfying enough.

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:50.130
Do you dare to drink from my jar?

00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:09.120
What do you think?

00:32:56.110 --> 00:32:57.970
Anyone else want to drink with me?

00:33:04.570 --> 00:33:05.490
Incredible.

00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:15.240
What's wrong?

00:33:15.510 --> 00:33:17.170
Still worried about Mr. Tang?

00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:19.430
What's there to worry about?

00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:20.870
I'm just out for a walk.

00:33:21.610 --> 00:33:22.840
All those in the Sword Alliance,

00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:25.200
together with the seven sword masters
including me,

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:27.000
usually bond through sparring.

00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:28.160
But besides that,

00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:29.660
there's another way
for those in the jianghu

00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:30.920
to build friendships.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.640
The swordsmen and elders in the Alliance
have different personalities,

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:37.090
but they all love to drink
and are good at it.

00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:48.900
Cheers!

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:51.100
Tonight we won't leave sober.

00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:51.990
Come join me.

00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:55.510
Mr. Tang's capacity for alcohol

00:33:55.510 --> 00:33:57.240
is truly remarkable.

00:33:57.730 --> 00:33:59.930
Mr. Tang, I must thank you.

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:01.330
Without you,

00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:02.270
they…

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:03.350
they wouldn't dare

00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:04.750
drink my snake bile wine.

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:07.400
Since coming to the Sword Alliance,

00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:08.880
I haven't once

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:10.480
used the snake poison again.

00:34:10.670 --> 00:34:11.960
I'm afraid they'll say

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:12.960
it's underhanded

00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:14.250
and call it cheating.

00:34:16.330 --> 00:34:17.600
Second Sword Master,

00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:19.330
you're drunk.

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:21.070
No, I'm not drunk.

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:24.210
Mr. Tang, let me tell you a secret.

00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:27.210
In the past, I wasn't called Snake Master.

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:29.300
I was called Poison Saint.

00:34:34.870 --> 00:34:36.400
That's barely a grievance!

00:34:36.770 --> 00:34:38.690
I am a swordsman,

00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:41.370
yet they make me keep the accounts.

00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:43.860
I don't dare embezzle a single coin.

00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:45.340
I don't dare take even one coin.

00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:46.199
But the ledger…

00:34:46.409 --> 00:34:47.520
the ledger is just…

00:34:47.550 --> 00:34:48.750
it can't be balanced.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.080
Every year…

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:51.840
every year, I have to
dig into my own pocket

00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:52.880
to fill the gaps.

00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:53.850
And I don't dare

00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:55.909
tell anyone about it.

00:34:58.190 --> 00:34:59.870
The Sword Alliance is so big,

00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:00.790
isn't it?

00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:03.430
When will I ever be able
to fill all the gaps?

00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:08.110
Mr. Tang,

00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:09.240
let's drink.

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:10.320
Sure.

00:35:17.970 --> 00:35:19.370
Sword Master Shangguan?

00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:21.400
Cheers!

00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:34.320
Only by drinking them under the table

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:36.630
will they take you as one of their own.

00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:40.290
Lici

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:41.760
leaves behind a life

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:42.960
of wealth and leisure

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.150
and insists on getting involved
in jianghu conflicts.

00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:47.170
He's only bringing trouble upon himself.

00:35:47.170 --> 00:35:49.170
I can't persuade him no matter what.

00:35:49.210 --> 00:35:51.380
Once the Fengliu Shop chaos is quelled,

00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:53.070
and the jianghu returns to peace,

00:35:53.070 --> 00:35:55.110
His Majesty can rest easy.

00:35:56.670 --> 00:35:57.400
Master Shao,

00:35:58.280 --> 00:35:59.190
actually, this time,

00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:00.450
there's one more thing

00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:01.960
His Majesty needs the Alliance's

00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:03.150
assistance with.

00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:04.330
We're glad to help.

00:36:04.330 --> 00:36:05.250
Please tell me.

00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:07.250
His Majesty has a daughter

00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:08.440
named Lang Ya.

00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:09.680
Over 10 years ago,

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:11.380
Yique Yinyang entered the court
and caused chaos.

00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:12.040
His Majesty

00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:14.110
was punished
for impeaching Yique Yinyang.

00:36:14.110 --> 00:36:16.780
During the turmoil,
he was separated from the princess.

00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:19.900
At that time, the princess was
only three years old.

00:36:20.530 --> 00:36:21.970
Now she is nearly 20.

00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:24.000
The chaos caused by Fengliu Shop

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.280
has once again made His Majesty

00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:26.740
recall his lost daughter.

00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:27.520
Therefore,

00:36:27.590 --> 00:36:29.580
His Majesty hopes to take this opportunity

00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:30.600
to entrust you guys

00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:32.480
with the task
of searching for the princess.

00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:34.400
Does she have any

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:36.260
tokens, birthmarks, or the like?

00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:38.320
The Empress once

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:39.230
had a butterfly tattoo inked

00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:41.230
on the princess's body,

00:36:41.350 --> 00:36:42.780
which can serve as an identifying mark.

00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:44.780
What kind of butterfly tattoo is it?

00:36:45.110 --> 00:36:46.870
If a drawing of it were available,

00:36:46.870 --> 00:36:49.070
-couldn't the tattoo be forged?
-Yeah.

00:36:49.930 --> 00:36:51.260
This butterfly tattoo—

00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:53.920
only the Emperor and the Empress

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:55.180
know its exact design.

00:36:55.570 --> 00:36:57.050
If anyone dares to fake it,

00:36:57.370 --> 00:36:58.830
that's treason against the sovereign

00:36:58.830 --> 00:37:00.390
and punishable by death.

00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:08.680
Perhaps, for you,

00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:10.670
building is easy,

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:13.440
and destroying is even easier.

00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:17.150
But that way, you can't own anything.

00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:20.630
Only when you can restrain yourself

00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:22.540
from knocking it down

00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:26.440
can you truly claim it as yours.

00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:13.230
♪ No one passes, and flowers fall ♪
