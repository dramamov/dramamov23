What's going on?

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.780
Aren't you scared at all?

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.070
Lici, are you really that silly?

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.870
Don't you even understand fear?

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.280
Forget it. You wouldn't understand anyway.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.740
But there is a kind of sound

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.940
that you can feel
even if you don't understand.

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:10.780
What is this?

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.830
Can I try too?

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.560
This is called music.

Here.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:20.600

What is the Mindfast Fox-Dragon?

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:05.970
It's a real treasure,

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.220
a flute that's very difficult to master.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.290
What's a flute?

is now inside my body,

and his body

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.900

Can't the Fengliu Shop stay in business
anymore?

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.240
Master, since your disappearance,

the Sword Alliance
has made thorough preparations.

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.380
He didn't lose his reputation.

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:18.950
Instead, he's become

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:20.480
the most famous marital artist

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.280
in the current martial arts world.

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.950
He's significantly strengthened
the Sword Alliance,

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:25.920
enabling it to amass sufficient fame,
fortune, and influence.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:26.830
He also has a group of

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.430

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.630
Leader, do you really think

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.890
Tang Lici is helping the Sword Alliance?

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:46.270
You're sworn enemies.

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:47.870
You can certainly see through him.

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:48.680
His next move

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.070
is already clear to you.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:51.480
Tang Lici is merely

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.480
using these fools

to deal with the Fengliu Shop.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.120
He wants them to be

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:57.270

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.000

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:01.750
If Tang Lici can use the Sword Alliance,

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.920
you can also use me to kill him.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.800
You think I can't kill him?

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:08.920
He is a true monster,

while you're not yet one.

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:12.720
That's why

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.510
you can't kill Tang Lici.

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:17.750
You don't do enough good
to be truly virtuous,

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.750

you can never reach
the extremes of good or evil.

What is Liu Yan looking for?

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:33.090
Why did he suddenly

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:35.200
return to Zhoudi Tower?

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:37.480
Why overthink it?

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:39.270
Let's investigate this Zhoudi Tower,

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:40.330
and we'll find out.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:46.530
If Liu Yan can't track things down

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:48.330
with the Hidden-Wing Curse Bug,

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.020
I can't find anything either.

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:52.000
Of course, we need
to ask the puppetry master

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.600
Qiaoyi Qiankun to investigate.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:54.510
He attacked the Biluo Palace

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:56.770
by using up a Sky-Fallen Stone fragment.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.270
He can't continue his research.

00:07:58.270 --> 00:07:59.820
Now, apart from the Biluo Palace,

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:01.880
only Puti Valley
possesses Sky-Fallen Stones.

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.000
If you give him another one,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.930
he'll be eternally grateful to you

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:07.360
and willing to do anything.

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:08.800
You're right.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.490
I can't believe
I had to remind you of this.

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:12.640
What a fool.

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:14.870
You may leave.

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:26.070
For what happened in the Qingyang Realm,

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:27.470
thank you, Master Puzhu.

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:30.110
I am willing to cooperate

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:31.750
because the Sword Alliance truly

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:32.809
needs Mr. Tang now.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.240
Yielding to circumstances

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:35.150
doesn't mean

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:36.549
I agree with

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:37.679
Mr. Tang's methods.

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:38.480
Same here.

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:43.960
Whatever works is a good strategy.

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:45.080
Why would I need

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.000
your approval?

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.630
Using money to buy loyalty

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:49.460
is not a good start.

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:50.710
Without any benefit,

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.120
you expect those disciples

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:53.600
to risk their lives fighting evil.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:54.320
Is that fair?

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.370
Using profit as bait

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:56.630
will lead to betrayal for profit.

00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:58.050
The Evil Pill spreads its poison

00:08:58.050 --> 00:08:59.770
precisely because of human greed

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:01.700
and delusions of instant success.

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.690
Pursuing benefits and avoiding harm

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:07.900
is human nature.

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:09.910
Isn't it a bit harsh

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:11.240
to hold ordinary people

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.480
to a sage's standard?

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:22.200
This is what they call,
"With great rewards

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.130
come brave men."

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:25.550
After the news has gotten out,

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:26.910
many sects want to join

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:29.030
the Sword Alliance's campaign
against the Fengliu Shop.

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:29.720
Moreover,

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:32.480
with the court
and the Biluo Palace's support,

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:35.080
the entire Sword Alliance's morale
has soared.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:36.010
I think we should

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.790
take advantage while people are willing

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:40.080
to fully eliminate
all Fengliu Shop strongholds.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.480
I've already sent Chunji

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.210
to lead a reconnaissance team.

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:44.670
Master Cheng,

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:46.110
what's your opinion?

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:49.140
Eliminating evil completely
is indeed my wish.

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:52.410
But...

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:55.280
Do we have to meet here?

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:56.510
It's so dark here,

00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:57.600
making us look like

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.660
we're plotting something sinister.

00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:03.850
Master Puzhu dislikes crowded places.

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:05.360
The deeper one is in darkness,

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.200
the more one craves for light.

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:10.830
With enemies at our doorstep,

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:12.100
if the Sword Alliance
needs anything in the future,

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:13.760
just send someone to inform me.

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:15.380
I will go to Wanhua Hall

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.840
to discuss matters with you.

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:17.390
Great.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:18.930
I never expected

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:20.690
Master Puzhu to be

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:23.180
someone who knows how to be flexible.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.490
To raid Fengliu Shop's strongholds,

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:34.620
I'll lead by example

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:36.250
and go ahead first.

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:38.750
Perfect.

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:40.550
Deputy Lord Yu

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:42.870
has just arrived at the Sword Alliance
with his people.

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:44.870
I'll go with you to see him.

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:47.360
Master Puzhu,

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:49.450
is it really so unbearable for you

00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:50.790
to work alongside me?

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:52.910
I've heard

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:54.920
that the disciples
of the Tianjing Pavilion

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:57.200
must practice meditation and tolerance.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:57.670
How is it

00:10:57.910 --> 00:11:00.040
that you don't need to practice these?

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:06.520
Farewell. Farewell.

00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:09.570
I wish you good luck on your journey.

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:18.020
If Master Cheng

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:19.600
also wants to talk about

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:21.190
approval

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:22.410
or other clichés,

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:23.750
I already know it.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.000
Perhaps you do have the skills

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.870
to fight against the Fengliu Shop.

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:30.390
But with your personality,

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:31.790
you can't inherit
the Seven‑String True Tune

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:32.790
of Fang Zhou.

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.080
Fang Zhou

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:41.610
was a man of integrity,

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:44.120
but in the end,

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:48.240
apart from people's respect,

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:50.410
what else did he get?

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.120
Asking such a question shows

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:56.250
you don't understand
Fang Zhou well enough.

00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:58.400
I don't want to be Fang Zhou.

00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:00.290
You can't be him either.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.240
You're suspected of being Yique Yinyang.

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:15.790
Though after the battle at Biluo Palace,

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:17.690
this suspicion was temporarily dispelled,

00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:19.620
but with your methods and actions,

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:21.030
no one can guarantee

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:22.750
that you won't become the next

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:23.750
Yique Yinyang.

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:26.080
You are a threat

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:27.770
to the Sword Alliance.

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:29.270
Tang Lici.

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:33.560
I'll be watching you.

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:36.970
You asked me before

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:39.000
if I've ever killed the wrong person
with my sword.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:39.860
Perhaps I have,

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:41.920
but I have no regrets.

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:43.370
For all my mistakes,

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:45.390
I will atone in hell.

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:52.410
Why are you laughing?

00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:57.630
Master Cheng, your words

00:12:57.630 --> 00:12:58.870
sound so resolute.

00:12:59.390 --> 00:12:59.870
Have you

00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:01.930
moved yourself with your own speech?

00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:02.920
However,

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:05.560
your desire to atone is one-sided.

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.250
Have you considered

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:09.160
whether those souls in hell

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:10.870
are willing to give you

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:12.270
a chance for redemption?

00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:46.360
Mr. Tang.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.330
Master Shao, you haven't slept all night.

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.690
The turmoil in the jianghu hasn't settled,

00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:55.620
making it impossible to rest easy.

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:00.800
Forgive my boldness,

00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:03.490
are you and the owner of the Fengliu Shop
Liu Yan

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:06.210
disciples of the same master?

00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:09.780
Chief Fang Zhou of Zhoudi Tower

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:11.720
was our senior.

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.150
Chief Fang Zhou of Zhoudi Tower

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:16.410
was a man of principle.

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:18.570
My master Jiangnan Feng and he

00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:21.010
once fought fiercely at Tiandu Peak,

00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:23.510
together resisting
Yique Yinyang's rebellion.

00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:25.970
Mr. Tang,
since you've inherited his legacy

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:27.660
and are willing to join us,

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:30.760
you must also have the desire
to help the world.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.120
But my purpose

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:34.120
has never been peace in the jianghu.

00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:35.720
That's not contradictory.

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:37.790
Didn't you once tell

00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:39.080
Master Puzhu

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:41.790
that even those with different paths
can work together?

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:43.720
As long as our current goals align,

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:45.480
why not journey together for a while?

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.150
Rest assured,
since we're traveling together,

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:48.120
I will handle

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:50.310
all Sword Alliance matters properly.

00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:51.240
However,

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:53.150
my methods in the future

00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:55.550
may be even more unacceptable
to ordinary people.

00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:57.080
You

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:59.940
might not have peace and quiet
for some time.

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:03.280
Everyone,

00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:04.630
don't be hasty!

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:06.320
Let's talk things through slowly!

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:06.960
Tang Lici!

00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:12.280
Take it easy. Calm down.

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:13.060
Let's talk this through.

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:13.970
Sword Masters.

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:15.510
What's the matter?

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:16.800
You've made a mistake in this decree.

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.190
I'm in charge of the Service Hall,

00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:19.720
not the Investigation Hall.

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:20.450
And mine too.

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:22.170
If you transfer me elsewhere,

00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:25.230
what will happen to my cases
at the Investigation Hall?

00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:27.950
Whatever you have received

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:30.000
is what you should follow.

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:32.510
You don't understand the Sword Alliance,

00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:34.000
so please stop messing things up.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:34.910
If you turn

00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:35.750
the Sword Alliance into chaos

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:36.790
and then just walk away,

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:38.250
what are we supposed to do?

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:41.080
Mr. Tang,

00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:42.640
even though you were

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:45.120
invited by
our Ancestor's divine revelation,

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:46.320
you still

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:47.520
can't be so arbitrary

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:48.790
and autocratic.

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:51.920
Master Jiang,

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:53.870
during your supervision of disciples,

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:55.440
their efficiency was poor,

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:56.790
and complaints were widespread.

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:57.920
The reason for this,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.000
in my opinion,

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:00.620
is that you prioritized
personal relationships

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:02.080
and lacked decisiveness.

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:04.540
Master Shangguan,

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:06.040
you were responsible
for the Sword Alliance's finances,

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:07.290
yet for all these years,

00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:09.580
the Sword Alliance
has been operating at a loss,

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:11.580
due to your poor management skills.

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:13.360
Master Pu,

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:15.320
as for your Investigation Hall,

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:17.080
30 cold cases in the jianghu

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:18.980
show absolutely no progress in a year.

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:20.030
The Sword Alliance's reputation

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:21.430
has greatly diminished.

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:22.650
It's because you

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:25.170
failed to investigate even minor issues.

00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:26.980
That's just empty talk.

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:28.790
The Sword Alliance's dossiers
for the past decade

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:29.520
are all here.

00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:31.870
Every word I've said

00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:33.390
is backed by evidence.

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:36.910
He's gone through 10 years of records?

00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:38.510
Doesn't this man ever sleep?

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:40.920
I know.

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:43.130
You've all done your best.

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:43.840
However,

00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:45.320
some matters,

00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:47.310
like opposing the Fengliu Shop,

00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:48.790
aren't just about effort

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:50.550
or determination to succeed.

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:53.550
Let's try this arrangement
for half a month.

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:55.550
Whether it works or is appropriate

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:56.910
will become clear

00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:58.720
after that time.

00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:01.970
What if your arrangement
proves even worse?

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.000
I will step down

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:06.310
and leave the Sword Alliance.

00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:07.569
That's not necessary.

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:09.800
Really not necessary.

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:11.160
You said it yourself.

00:17:11.349 --> 00:17:12.060
Well then,

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:14.069
let's follow Mr. Tang's arrangement

00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:14.730
and give it a try.

00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:15.990
It's only half a month.

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:18.010
The time will pass quickly.

00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:18.680
Fine.

00:17:20.869 --> 00:17:23.000
Since I've come to the Sword Alliance,

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:25.420
I won't be leaving again.

00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:28.270
[Fallen Shisan Tower]

00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:28.790
Master.

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:30.340
We found that Tang Lici

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:32.030
has taken over the Sword Alliance.

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:33.290
He's gathering forces

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:35.650
to fight against the Fengliu Shop.

00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:36.440
Also,

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:37.750
the item you requested

00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:38.920
is ready.

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:46.750
Tang Lici.

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:49.440
I know how to get

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:51.040
the Rebirth Scroll from you.

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:53.400
I'll go to the Sword Alliance now

00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:55.950
to bring you a special gift.

00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:06.050
Let's go. Let's go.

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:07.750
Fan.

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:09.750
Are you also here
to join the Sword Alliance

00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:11.070
to fight against the Fengliu Shop?

00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:11.590
Yes.

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:13.720
There are so many martial artists

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:14.520
coming today.

00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:16.590
This time we'll surely succeed.

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:20.210
This time we can definitely
stand against the Fengliu Shop.

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:26.200
He's blocked the road again.

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:26.880
Such a troublemaker.

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:27.350
Indeed.

00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:29.480
You two can't even catch

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:30.340
a single child?

00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:31.730
Stop, stop!

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:36.880
Stop, stop!

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:56.610
Leave this to me.

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:37.800
This is called martial arts.

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:40.860
You've built so many stone fortresses.

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:43.920
Are you trying to hide inside them
to protect yourself?

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:45.920
But

00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:49.290
stones can't protect you.

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:52.690
You need to protect them instead.

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:56.050
I want to teach him to read first,

00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:57.850
then teach him our martial arts.

00:19:58.470 --> 00:19:59.270
One day,

00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:00.400
you will use them

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:02.270
to protect what matters to you.

00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:05.390
I can teach you martial arts.

00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:07.170
With martial arts,

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:08.150
in the future,

00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:10.630
you'll be able to protect these stones.

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:11.930
However,

00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:13.920
you must promise me.

00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:16.080
You can only stack stones here.

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:18.610
You can't block other people's paths.

00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:32.150
You don't understand anything.

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:35.400
Then I'll teach you
the "Three Character Classic" first.

00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:38.880
Men.

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:40.750
On.

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:42.750
Earth.

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:46.350
Good.

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:48.160
At.

00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:52.010
Today I'll teach you
to recognize characters.

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:05.720
It reads "Man on earth, good at birth."

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:07.720
It means

00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:09.850
when we are born,

00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:11.830
we are all good people.

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:14.440
The reason some people become bad later

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:17.730
is that they are influenced by bad things.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:19.830
So, Lici,

00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:23.990
you must believe that in your heart,

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:25.950
there is always love.

00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:34.110
Man on earth.

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:36.440
Man on earth.

00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:37.680
Good at birth.

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:39.700
Good at birth.

00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:43.960
Lici,

00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:46.100
you're learning very well.

00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:49.200
Lici,

00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:51.770
resist the urge

00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:55.500
to knock over this sandcastle.

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:10.090
People do bad things

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:13.830
because they're influenced by bad things.

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:15.490
That's why they do bad things.

00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:19.240
Understand?

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:25.270
Tang Lici.

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:28.440
Damn the Central Plains Sword Alliance!

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:29.270
We've had several

00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:30.200
of our strongholds raided!

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:32.800
And you just wait here
without doing anything!

00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:37.000
East Palace Chief.

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:38.910
When will you understand

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:41.270
that anger solves nothing?

00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:42.310
Am I angry?

00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:44.880
Am I that angry?

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:47.370
Where is Master?

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:49.640
Where has Master gone at a time like this?

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:50.700
Is our Fengliu Shop

00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:52.720
just going to be bullied like this?

00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:56.360
If you don't want to wait
for Master to return,

00:22:57.070 --> 00:22:59.200
you can go face them yourself.

00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:00.680
Fine, I'll go!

00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:06.910
If I go,

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:08.350
what about you?

00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:10.270
I'll stay here

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:11.950
waiting for Master to return.

00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:13.750
Give me a break.

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:16.070
Don't think that if Master and I died,

00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:17.750
you could become the new Master

00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:19.400
and be equal to Leader.

00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:21.160
Keep dreaming!

00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:42.670
What's all this noise about?

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:49.110
Greetings, Master.

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:50.770
Greetings, Master.

00:23:56.150 --> 00:23:56.740
Fucui.

00:23:57.960 --> 00:23:59.790
You thought I was dead just now,

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:00.780
didn't you?

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:02.550
No, no, no.

00:24:03.270 --> 00:24:03.920
Not at all.

00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:05.190
I just feel

00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:06.550
that the Central Plains Sword Alliance

00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:08.030
is taking a mile when given an inch.

00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:09.290
They're going too far.

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:11.000
I was just upset for a moment.

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:13.640
Fucui actually managed to say

00:24:13.670 --> 00:24:14.930
2 idioms in one breath.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.660
I guess pressure does
bring out quick thinking.

00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:21.480
Xifang Tao!

00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:22.710
You...

00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:24.880
Master.

00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:26.320
Since Tang Lici

00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:28.830
became the Guest of Honor
of the Sword Alliance,

00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:30.510
he's raided our several

00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:31.680
hidden places!

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:33.620
This time's loss is much greater

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:35.290
than that in Sword King City!

00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:37.160
We can't just sit and wait for death.

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:38.360
We need to fight back!

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:40.530
What's the rush?

00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:46.420
Hearts that can be bought with money

00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:48.970
can just as easily be torn apart
by other means.

00:24:48.970 --> 00:24:50.970
They've overestimated themselves

00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:54.460
and also underestimated me

00:24:55.690 --> 00:24:56.890
and the Fengliu Shop.

00:24:58.680 --> 00:24:59.550
Take this

00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:01.740
to mobilize our people.

00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:25.000
Master.

00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:27.030
Chunji, you're back.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.330
Let me have a look at you.

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:30.520
Very good.

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:31.280
Very good.

00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:34.430
Chunji, your leadership of the disciples

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:35.750
in raiding

00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:36.880
the Fengliu Shop's strongholds

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:38.210
is extremely well done.

00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:39.660
Thank you for your hard work.

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:40.920
This is simply my duty.

00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:43.270
However, Master,

00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:44.430
recently,

00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:46.340
the Sword Alliance's reputation
has grown tremendously.

00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:47.560
Every day, there are many new people

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:48.960
in the martial arts world joining us.

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:49.880
These newcomers

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:51.880
don't understand the rules
of the Sword Alliance yet.

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:53.030
They need someone

00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:54.510
to guide and lead them.

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:56.590
So can I...

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:59.160
It's time to return
to the Shanfeng Branch.

00:25:59.160 --> 00:25:59.680
Yes.

00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:01.650
Now everyone knows

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:03.140
that Mr. Tang is innocent.

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:04.600
So what I did back then

00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:06.860
wasn't really wrong, was it?

00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:07.830
Have you forgotten?

00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:09.230
Didn't I tell you before?

00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:10.590
I punished you because you

00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:11.610
released a suspect without permission.

00:26:11.610 --> 00:26:13.700
That wasn't releasing a suspect at all.

00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:14.970
It was clearly some Sword Masters

00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:15.880
trying to take advantage

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:18.080
to replace me with their own disciples.

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:19.480
Some things

00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:20.880
are better left understood

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:21.790
but unspoken.

00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:26.920
Alright.

00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:28.350
Chunji,

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:30.750
the position of Shanfeng Branch Chief

00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:31.880
is still vacant now.

00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:33.240
As long as you take it step by step

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:34.580
and remain steady and reliable,

00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:36.240
what's meant to be yours will be yours.

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:38.240
It's just not the right time yet.

00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:41.070
Yes, yes.

00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:42.570
I understand, Master.

00:26:45.610 --> 00:26:46.340
I'm leaving.

00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:49.540
I'm leaving.

00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:54.530
Such a troublesome one.

00:26:57.800 --> 00:26:58.970
Good. Next.

00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:09.550
Thank you. Next.

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:10.920
What's your name?

00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:13.720
How many people have come today?

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:16.750
Zhong.

00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:17.760
You're back.

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:23.000
Ms. Zhong.

00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:24.520
Today, we've had

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:26.070
160 people join

00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:27.480
the Sword Alliance.

00:27:27.530 --> 00:27:29.260
Including those still in line,

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:30.540
there are 200 more.

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:31.680
You can leave.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:32.640
Our Sword Alliance

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:34.170
welcomes talented people,

00:27:34.390 --> 00:27:35.830
but we don't accept just anyone

00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:37.690
looking for free food and drinks.

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:40.810
That's not quite right.

00:27:40.810 --> 00:27:42.610
I may be a nobody,

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:44.260
but I never cheat for food.

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:46.720
No sect, no martial arts skills.

00:27:46.810 --> 00:27:47.200
[Master of Fate]
[Divine Fortune Teller]

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:48.110
If you don't mooch around
and cheat for a living,

00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:49.240
what else can you do?

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:51.970
You really don't recognize me?

00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:53.320
Should we know you?

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:54.640
Are we supposed to?

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:55.640
No, no.

00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:56.410
Good.

00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:58.060
Since we're strangers,

00:27:58.310 --> 00:27:59.710
let me tell your fortune.

00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:04.450
What's going on?

00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:06.230
Senior Zhong.

00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:07.550
He's a jianghu con artist.

00:28:07.550 --> 00:28:08.680
We'll handle it right away.

00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:09.080
Got it!

00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:13.240
Li Dayou, 18 years old.

00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:15.050
Born in the Year of the Pig.

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:16.110
Wrong.

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:17.680
His surname is Zhang.

00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:18.480
Wait.

00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:21.700
My birth father's surname was indeed Li.

00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:22.750
It was after my mother remarried

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:23.440
that I changed my surname.

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:24.640
How did you know that?

00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:29.350
I also know

00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:31.210
you had good luck with money today,

00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:32.400
but unfortunately,

00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:34.030
you lost it all at once.

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:35.270
Wrong.

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:37.000
He made a mistake this morning

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.640
and was just fined a month's salary.

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:40.640
I did find a money pouch.

00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:42.960
It's worth more than my monthly salary.

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:43.830
It was you!

00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:44.960
So my money pouch

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:46.030
was picked up by you.

00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:46.550
Give it back to me now.

00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:47.590
I found this.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.550
How can you prove it's yours?

00:28:49.550 --> 00:28:51.150
What disgraceful behavior.

00:28:51.270 --> 00:28:52.360
I've heard

00:28:52.390 --> 00:28:53.400
that the Sword Alliance has welcomed

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:55.060
a Guest of Honor surnamed Tang

00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:56.110
and issued a notice.

00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:58.200
It states that anyone with a skill,

00:28:58.270 --> 00:28:59.330
of good character,

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:00.270
and willing to

00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:01.310
resist the Fengliu Shop

00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:03.030
and contribute to the cause

00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:05.260
can join the Sword Alliance.

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:06.160
Tell me,

00:29:06.550 --> 00:29:07.510
I've traveled

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:09.550
over mountains and ridges to get here.

00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:11.480
Doesn't that count for something?

00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:14.750
The Sword Alliance's announcement
is certainly valid.

00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:16.200
Please state your name first.

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:17.130
Thank you, Miss.

00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:19.110
My name is Fang Zhou.

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:22.970
Pleased to meet you.

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:26.920
What's your name?

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:27.920
Fang Zhou.

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:29.790
Fang as in square.

00:29:29.790 --> 00:29:30.680
Zhou as in boat.

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:32.510
Do you know

00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:35.270
Head Fang of Zhoudi Tower

00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:36.880
had the same name?

00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:39.000
Well,

00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:40.810
there's nothing I can do about it.

00:29:40.810 --> 00:29:42.410
My parents gave me this name.

00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:44.590
It's my honor
to share the same pronunciation

00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:46.070
as Head Fang's name.

00:29:46.290 --> 00:29:48.000
Surely Head Fang was generous enough

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.750
to tolerate someone like me.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:50.550
Besides,

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:52.200
Head Fang's "Zhou" means

00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:54.350
encompassing the world,

00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:55.460
while my "Zhou" is just

00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:57.110
a lonely boat drifting

00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:58.790
in this vast universe.

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:02.440
Even so,

00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:04.630
I kindly advise you

00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:06.360
if you meet Mr. Tang,

00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:08.560
you'd better

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:10.830
not mention your name.

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:12.550
Why?

00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:15.850
Just because my name is also Fang Zhou?

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:17.920
There are countless people
with the same name.

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:19.070
Besides me, there must be

00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:20.750
thousands of other Fang Zhous.

00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:21.720
Are you saying

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:23.850
Mr. Tang can't stand to see any of them?

00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:26.600
Is he really that arbitrary
and domineering?

00:30:26.790 --> 00:30:27.510
Yeah.

00:30:27.790 --> 00:30:29.160
That's too domineering.

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:30.310
That's so unreasonable.

00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:32.160
How is Mr. Tang being arbitrary
and domineering?

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:32.830
You don't know him,

00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:34.230
so don't speak nonsense.

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:40.690
This is indeed my fault.

00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:42.960
I apologize to you, Miss.

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:44.780
Alright, alright.

00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:47.110
We don't stand on ceremony
at the Sword Alliance.

00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:49.110
Go get your disciple uniform first.

00:30:49.210 --> 00:30:50.400
Thank you very much, Miss.

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:52.030
Don't go! Read my fortune!

00:30:52.510 --> 00:30:53.750
Tell my fortune!

00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:55.480
Don't rush. Don't rush.

00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:56.480
One at a time.

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:00.590
Good.

00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:02.790
Obviously,

00:31:02.790 --> 00:31:04.850
this is a diagram of human meridians.

00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:05.740
So today,

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:07.890
I'll be explaining to everyone

00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:09.590
how the modified version

00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:10.640
of the Blood Ghost Pill
from the Fengliu Shop

00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:12.300
causes harm to the human body.

00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:15.070
Of course,
my explanation might be insufficient.

00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:16.530
Shen will fill in the gaps.

00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:18.180
What's the difference

00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:19.590
between the current Blood Ghost Pill

00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:20.960
and the poison pill
spread by the Jile Sect

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:22.220
from over a decade ago?

00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:25.070
The former is more potent,
and its toxicity is more concealed.

00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:26.920
The one who refined the poison pill
is not anyone else

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:27.680
but the current Master

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:29.000
of the Fengliu Shop, Liu Yan.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:29.960
Fine, fine.

00:31:30.490 --> 00:31:33.620
The underworld is giving a lesson
to the upright people.

00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:35.070
Indeed, when you live long enough,

00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:36.400
you'll see everything.

00:31:36.490 --> 00:31:37.590
Among these people,

00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:39.240
only Chi Yun and Shen Langhun

00:31:39.370 --> 00:31:40.830
fought against people

00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:41.960
who took the new Evil Pill.

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:43.490
The poison pill he modified

00:31:43.790 --> 00:31:44.550
can make the user's power

00:31:44.550 --> 00:31:45.790
increase more than tenfold.

00:31:45.790 --> 00:31:46.880
You sneaky fox,

00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:48.970
always appearing out of nowhere.

00:31:49.790 --> 00:31:50.480
I heard

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:52.200
a fortune teller
joined the Sword Alliance.

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:54.000
Why don't you go see him?

00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:55.790
A fortune teller?

00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:58.720
I saw you and Shei

00:31:58.790 --> 00:32:00.790
whispering by the stream.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.110
I'm saying you should go see him too,

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:05.640
to see if someone as ice-cold as you

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:06.900
can turn into a softie.

00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:15.830
It's over. It's over.

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:18.270
It's all over. It's all over.

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:23.240
You'll soon face a bloody disaster.

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:25.200
How can I avoid it?
Do you have any magic charms?

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:26.000
Magic charms?

00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:28.310
Of course not.

00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:30.030
Just don't go outside,

00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:31.090
and you'll be fine.

00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:32.400
Thank you, Mr. Fang.

00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:33.530
Thank you, Mr. Fang.

00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:35.880
That won't work.

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:37.310
We have to get up at dawn

00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:38.880
to practice sword formations.

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:39.750
This was arranged

00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:40.880
by Mr. Tang.

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:42.510
He makes you get up at dawn?

00:32:42.510 --> 00:32:43.640
-Yes.
-That's right.

00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:44.340
Yes.

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:45.990
What is Mr. Tang thinking?

00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:47.740
What's on Mr. Tang's mind?

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:49.200
How would ordinary disciples like us

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:49.960
know?

00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:52.310
Could you decipher this for us?

00:32:52.810 --> 00:32:53.370
Yes.

00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:54.070
Please do us a favor.

00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:54.830
Please.

00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:55.680
Let me try.

00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:57.880
If you want to know what's on my mind,

00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:00.550
why don't you ask me directly?

00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:01.940
-Mr. Tang.
-Mr. Tang.

00:33:04.030 --> 00:33:05.230
You haven't paid yet.

00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:13.380
Interesting.

00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:14.510
Welcome.

00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:16.830
Would you like your future read

00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:18.430
or your lifespan predicted?

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:22.940
My surname is Fang,
courtesy name Pingzhai,

00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:25.790
and nickname Carefree.

00:33:27.290 --> 00:33:30.100
So Mr. Carefree Fang,

00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:34.290
your profession is fortune-telling?

00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:37.320
Just a humble skill.

00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:39.000
It's not even one-tenth

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.200
of what I've learned.

00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:40.910
By the way,

00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:43.730
let me formally introduce myself.

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:46.310
My surname is Fang, given name Zhou,

00:33:48.270 --> 00:33:49.870
and courtesy name Pingzhai.

00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:51.720
Pleased to meet you.

00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:56.000
What did you say your name is?

00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:58.520
I am

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:00.270
Fang Zhou.

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:13.150
You don't stay in Fallen Shisan Tower.

00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:16.710
Why have you come to the Sword Alliance?

00:34:16.870 --> 00:34:19.389
You know,
the Sword Alliance is open to all.

00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:20.790
If you can come

00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:22.190
and Shen can come,

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:23.760
why can't I come?

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:26.630
I also wish to follow the righteous path.

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:30.480
What do you want?

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:37.710
Mr. Tang,

00:34:38.690 --> 00:34:40.880
you have a supreme martial art technique

00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:42.880
called the Rebirth Scroll.

00:34:45.070 --> 00:34:47.070
Endless Secrets of Heaven and Earth,

00:34:47.070 --> 00:34:49.280
Liuli Rebirth Scroll.

00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:59.080
You've given yourself away.

00:35:01.150 --> 00:35:02.320
Chief Fang.

00:35:08.070 --> 00:35:09.320
Fallen Shisan Tower.

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:12.840
Chief Fang of Dieban Chonghua.

00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:16.540
What do you want with the Rebirth Scroll?

00:35:17.290 --> 00:35:19.030
You claim to join the righteous path,

00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:19.880
yet you're here for

00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:22.120
Yique Yinyang's martial arts technique.

00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:23.560
I've been exposed.

00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:25.150
Why don't you just play along with me

00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:25.840
for a while?

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:28.780
But come to think of it,

00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:31.760
you possess
Yique Yinyang's martial arts technique,

00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:32.760
and you've become

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:34.890
a Guest of Honor of the Sword Alliance.

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:36.540
Is there a problem?

00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:38.300
Forget it.

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:42.320
Since the Guest of Honor
of the Sword Alliance can't offer it,

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:43.800
I'd like to see

00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:47.320
whether Master Liu
from the Fengliu Shop will give it to me.

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:48.380
Stay away from him.

00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:51.150
Otherwise,

00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:54.760
I'll make sure

00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:57.340
you'll get it but won't live to use it.

00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:02.360
Mr. Tang, I've read your fortune.

00:36:02.850 --> 00:36:04.450
The results are surprising.

00:36:08.010 --> 00:36:11.340
You're not a human of this world

00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:14.480
but a fox demon.

00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:22.090
Then you should also know

00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:25.030
that fox demons excel at

00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:27.200
gutting humans

00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:30.150
and digging out their hearts

00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:31.930
to examine them closely

00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:34.910
to see if they're loyal or treacherous.

00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:45.690
Why is it you again?

00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:47.230
We hired you

00:36:47.230 --> 00:36:48.630
not to deceive others.

00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:50.280
Mr. Tang,

00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:51.000
did he

00:36:51.530 --> 00:36:53.050
tell you any nonsense?

00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:54.190
Ms. Zhong,

00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:55.600
long time no see.

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:57.210
Long time no see.

00:36:57.510 --> 00:36:58.570
Don't worry, Miss.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:36:59.880
Mr. Tang

00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:01.950
has found me a good job.

00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:04.880
I won't be fortune-telling anymore.

00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:05.680
That's right.

00:37:06.490 --> 00:37:08.380
A job very suitable for Mr. Fang.

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:12.800
During your time working
at the Service Hall,

00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:13.760
I hope you

00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:15.030
can think carefully

00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:17.490
whether you want to be honest

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:18.600
with me or not.

00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:22.190
You want me to do odd jobs?

00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:23.190
Do them properly.

00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:36.440
When did you return, Ms. Zhong?

00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:39.690
About 2 days ago.

00:37:40.070 --> 00:37:41.710
Master said you were busy.

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:43.920
If I hadn't seen you
while passing by just now,

00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:45.880
I wouldn't have come to bother you again.

00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:47.080
Even if we hadn't met,

00:37:47.810 --> 00:37:49.810
I would come looking for you anyway.

00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:04.960
I heard

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.530
that you lost your position

00:38:07.590 --> 00:38:10.520
as Branch Chief
of the Shanfeng Branch because of me.

00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:13.800
I lost my position

00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:16.280
because someone else wanted it.

00:38:17.110 --> 00:38:18.000
Mr. Tang, you don't need

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.930
to take everything upon yourself.

00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:20.960
I just

00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:22.800
feel it's unfair.

00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:27.790
There's no such thing as fair or unfair.

00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:28.670
It has always been about

00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:30.530
whether others choose you or not.

00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:31.630
I think

00:38:32.190 --> 00:38:33.150
Master Shao must

00:38:33.150 --> 00:38:34.680
have his own difficulties.

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:37.960
Ms. Zhong.

00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:41.180
Come with me to a place.

00:38:43.590 --> 00:38:44.120
Let's go.

00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:50.920
The food is ready.

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:53.050
And the wine is here.

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:55.190
Did you twist your ankle, Miss Shei?

00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:55.920
Take it easy.

00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:57.320
Ms. Zhong.

00:39:01.730 --> 00:39:02.230
Zhong.

00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:03.030
Ms. Zhong.

00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:09.510
Everyone's here.

00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:13.400
Why are you so late?

00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:15.590
We've been waiting for you
for a long time.

00:39:15.590 --> 00:39:17.590
Shen and I finished our lessons ages ago.

00:39:17.590 --> 00:39:19.430
Those Sword Masters
kept asking us questions.

00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:20.270
They asked me.

00:39:20.290 --> 00:39:22.150
You couldn't explain it clearly.

00:39:24.030 --> 00:39:24.630
Ms. Zhong,

00:39:25.050 --> 00:39:25.980
please sit down.

00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:27.340
Come, have a seat.

00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:37.050

I

00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:42.280
feel it's completely unfair for you.

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:42.590

When we battle against the Fengliu Shop,

00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:46.730
Yanmen Sect will lead the charge,

00:39:46.730 --> 00:39:47.060

Take it easy.

00:39:51.490 --> 00:39:52.730

no need for thanks.

00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:17.240
Fengliu Shop

00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:17.970

What wine did you bring, Jiang?

00:40:37.630 --> 00:40:39.630
This is the finest wine from Yanmen.

00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:41.230
Frosty Leaves' Red.

00:40:41.590 --> 00:40:43.650
A Yanmen specialty, excellent wine.

No.

I just feel

00:41:27.070 --> 00:41:28.330
that it feels like ages

since I last saw everyone.

00:41:31.070 --> 00:41:33.150
The last time we went to Sword King City

00:41:33.150 --> 00:41:35.480
seems like it happened in a previous life.

00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:39.670
I'd like to toast everyone.

00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:41.830
No matter how much time passes,

00:41:41.830 --> 00:41:43.690
we should always drink together.

00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:45.290
You always know what to say.

00:42:11.330 --> 00:42:13.530
You seem very happy tonight, Ms. Zhong.

00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:15.180
Why is it you again?

00:42:16.590 --> 00:42:17.710
Do you need something?

00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:18.760
I asked you first.

00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:20.840
So you should answer me first.

00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:22.430
Of course I'm happy.

00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:23.960
Your turn.

00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:25.440
I don't have anything specific.

00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:25.880
Why?

00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:28.490
Can't I chat with you without a reason?

00:42:31.310 --> 00:42:32.790
You're so strange.

00:42:33.630 --> 00:42:34.760
If you came to the Sword Alliance

00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:36.090
with other intentions,

00:42:36.250 --> 00:42:37.250
I suggest

00:42:38.140 --> 00:42:39.420
you leave now.

00:42:40.510 --> 00:42:41.970
You're quite perceptive.

00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:43.230
Fine.

00:42:43.590 --> 00:42:44.390
I'll tell you.

00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:46.480
I came to the Sword Alliance

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:47.960
to see

00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:50.110
the true face of the fox demon.

00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:52.590
Why?

00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:53.820
Why?

00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:55.760
Because...

00:42:56.690 --> 00:42:59.290
Mr. Tang is indeed detestable and hateful,

00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:00.960
but I must admit

00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:04.000
that he does have a captivating charm.

00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:06.150
It makes one unable to resist

00:43:06.510 --> 00:43:08.000
falling deeply for him.

00:43:11.670 --> 00:43:13.280
You dare to provoke Mr. Tang?

00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:16.510
Aren't you afraid
that you'll bring disaster upon yourself?

00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:18.880
It's the danger that makes it attractive.

00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:19.880
You

00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:22.210
understand this feeling best, don't you?

00:43:24.150 --> 00:43:26.240
What are you talking about?

00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:29.280
What I want to say is,

00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:30.960
to get his attention,

00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:33.520
you can't follow the ordinary path.

00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:36.760
You need to be the most special person.

00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:38.920
Don't let yourself need him;

00:43:39.290 --> 00:43:41.690
make him need you instead.

00:43:43.380 --> 00:43:45.300
What's between Mr. Tang and me

00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:47.480
is none of your business.

00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:50.510
To be honest,

00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:52.240
I've read your fortune too.

00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:55.840
Your destiny shows weak family bonds

00:43:56.110 --> 00:43:57.510
and no power or wealth.

00:43:58.030 --> 00:43:59.630
What others are born with,

00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:01.230
you must fight desperately to obtain—

00:44:01.230 --> 00:44:03.630
only then might you stand a slim chance
of getting it.

00:44:03.630 --> 00:44:05.490
If you miss just one opportunity,

00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:08.320
you'll lose everything.

00:44:14.070 --> 00:44:15.440
Mr. Fang, do you think

00:44:15.730 --> 00:44:17.260
I would believe your words?

00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:19.170
It doesn't matter if you don't.

00:44:19.170 --> 00:44:20.230
But if I were you,

00:44:20.230 --> 00:44:21.440
with such a fate,

00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:22.480
I would contentedly

00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:23.880
be an ordinary disciple

00:44:24.590 --> 00:44:26.320
and marry a simple, honest man.

00:44:27.110 --> 00:44:28.370
Why struggle for more?

00:44:29.590 --> 00:44:31.320
What if I insist on struggling?

00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:36.960
Then I can help you.

00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:44.320
I don't need it.

00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:49.920
Think carefully,

00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:51.170
Ms. Zhong.

00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:21.770
A letter from Shisan Tower.

00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:24.650
The Peach of Three Hues in Pink Attire.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:27.190
She is Xifang Tao.

00:45:48.490 --> 00:45:50.350
Hand it to Godfather personally.

00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:52.370
Bring back his reply.

00:45:54.690 --> 00:45:57.020
Aren't you going
to ask what this is about?

00:45:58.220 --> 00:46:00.080
I don't have Chi Yun's curiosity.

00:46:00.630 --> 00:46:01.630
The more you know,

00:46:02.030 --> 00:46:03.090
the sooner you die.

00:46:13.370 --> 00:46:14.210
Sometimes,

00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:16.320
the more you know,

00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:18.280
the better your chances.

00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:20.320
Fang Pingzhai,

00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:22.000
your true identity

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.480
is about to be revealed.
