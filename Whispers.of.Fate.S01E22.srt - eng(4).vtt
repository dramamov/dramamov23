this will make them angry

Master Shao, you think

I'm too old to be reading

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:00.220

No, no.

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:03.800
He who reflects on the past
and gains insight from it is fit to teach.

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:04.860
Didn't you take Stone

as your disciple?

00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:07.550
Teaching him the Three Character Classic

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:08.230
is perfect.

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:11.440
I'm just teaching him a few characters.

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:12.840
He's hardly my disciple.

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:23.550
Master Shao, you look

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:25.060
so worried and gloomy again.

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:27.150
Is something important troubling you?

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:29.150
I received a message from Master Ji.

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:33.460
He said it's been rather unsettled
out there recently.

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:34.630

who were away on missions

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:38.430
were brutally killed by the Fengliu Shop.

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:40.090
More than 10 have been killed.

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:41.430
I'll go back and practice as well.

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:42.060
Alright.

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:55.910
This killing method

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:57.280
doesn't seem like Fengliu Shop's work,

00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:59.420
but more like an assassin's technique.

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:01.020
Sixth Sword Master, well...

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:04.790
Unable to confront us directly,

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:07.760
they've resorted to assassination.

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:08.930
This is outrageous.

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:13.650
Send a message to Master Shao immediately.

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:14.180
Yes!

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:19.780
It's a trap.

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:21.320
Exactly.

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:23.970
They deliberately chose
this moment to strike—

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:25.180
it's a trap meant

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:26.100
to provoke us.

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:28.630
I'm afraid their hidden agenda

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:31.050
is more complex than it seems.

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:33.520
Also,

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:35.860
there are some rumors

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:38.120
circulating within the Sword Alliance.

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:39.580
However,

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:41.270
I'm already tracking down

00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:42.800
the source of those rumors.

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:49.210
Master Shao, do you know...

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:51.510
a fortune-teller has joined

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:52.770
the alliance recently, and he's

00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:55.470
-doing odd jobs in the Service Hall?
-After Mr. Tang came here,

00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:58.200
though your basic needs
are well provided for...

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:00.200
have your lives...

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:03.460
truly gotten better?

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:05.580
Fengliu Shop keeps attacking

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:06.590
you alliance disciples.

00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:08.920
Are you just going to swallow this insult?

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:10.880
Perhaps Mr. Tang is

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.310
making careful plans.

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:14.220
Plans?

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:16.390
What kind of plans?

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:17.940
That we don't know.

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:19.100
But I believe Mr. Tang

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:21.080
certainly won't stand by and do nothing.

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:21.780
Indeed.

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:24.310
Since he keeps saying

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:25.550
he wants to eliminate Fengliu Shop,

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:26.980
why does he only teach you

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:28.580
lightness skills for escape

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:31.330
and sword formations
that merely delay enemies?

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.890
No matter how well-coordinated
your sword formations are,

00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:35.860
can they allow you to take the initiative

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:37.460
and eliminate Fengliu Shop?

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.480
Or can they protect you

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:42.230
from enemy ambushes when you're alone?

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:44.180
That makes some sense.

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:44.640
Indeed.

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:47.730
I can't dispute that.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:50.570
I've heard about it.

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:51.910
What?

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:54.210
Is there something wrong with him?

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:55.050
A serious one.

00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:56.910
Then...

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:58.040
I'll have someone

00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:59.170
bring him to see you?

00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:00.370
No rush.

00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:02.300
When Chi Yun returns,

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:03.710
I'll find him myself.

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:06.270
I hear it.

00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:08.810
Someone is calling my name.

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:10.650
Are you

00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:12.740
really

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:14.080
desperately

00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:15.710
in need of me right now?

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:24.550
The capable bear more work.

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:25.630
I guess I'll have to do you a favor

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:27.230
and run this errand for you, Foxy Tang.

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:28.890
You seem quite happy about it.

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:40.220
I just find it strange—

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:43.220
since Mr. Tang has
unmatched martial arts skills,

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:44.750
why doesn't he teach those skills

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:46.060
to each one of us?

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:49.220
If we all improve even a little,

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:52.100
when the final battle
with Fengliu Shop comes,

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:53.180
each of us could

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:54.580
contribute more, right?

00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:55.980
Mr. Tang probably

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:57.310
wouldn't need that extra help, would he?

00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:58.390
Am I right?

00:13:58.390 --> 00:13:59.060
-Yes.
-Yeah.

00:13:59.060 --> 00:13:59.460
That's right.

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:00.180
Indeed.

00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:04.440
Well, Mr. Tang is so confident

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:05.910
that he's staking everything

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:06.910
on himself alone.

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:07.580
What if

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:08.630
he never actually intended to

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:10.350
destroy Fengliu Shop in the first place?

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:12.080
Wouldn't we all be doomed then?

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:13.670
Use your brains, guys.

00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:17.550
How impressive

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:19.810
that you possess such insight, Mr. Fang.

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:23.070
Mr. Tang.

00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:24.100
-Mr. Tang
-Mr. Tang.

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:24.820
Mr. Tang.

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:25.700
Mr. Tang.

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:32.150
With everyone watching,

00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:33.700
surely you wouldn't kill me

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:34.940
over a few unpleasant words,

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:36.270
would you?

00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:42.460
Let's go. Let's go.

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:43.860
-Let's go.
-We should go.

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:46.870
Here to greet me?

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:50.770
[Master of Fate; Divine Fortune Teller]

00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:01.340
Mr. Fang, it seems

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:02.670
you still don't enjoy

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:04.600
your duties at the Sword Alliance.

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:05.450
Not at all.

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:07.450
I love the Sword Alliance,

00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:09.380
and the disciples here love me too.

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:12.200
Mr. Tang, though you appear calm
on the surface,

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.100
you must be

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:14.630
seething inside.

00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:18.110
But if those disciples

00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:21.370
were to see you kill me in rage,

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:23.950
how would you resolve that situation?

00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:26.010
What are they talking about?

00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:29.730
Mr. Fang, you're so good at
fortune-telling,

00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:30.700
yet you can't divine

00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:32.360
whether I will kill you or not?

00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:35.710
How interesting, Mr. Tang.

00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:37.030
The last time

00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:38.430
you came to Shisan Tower,

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:40.820
you were indifferent to everything.

00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:42.480
I never expected
that in such a short time,

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:44.610
everything would change completely.

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:46.060
It seems that when people have something

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:47.310
to protect,

00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:49.620
they become like dogs

00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:51.940
on a leash.

00:15:58.100 --> 00:15:58.830
Don't you...

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:01.150
have something

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:02.340
you want to protect,

00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:03.700
Chai Xijin?

00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:10.340
Lici,

00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:12.220
the person you inquired about,

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:15.030
is the sixth prince
of the former dynasty, Chai Xijin.

00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:17.290
He was still young when the kingdom fell.

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:19.030
Fortunately, with the help of
loyal ministers,

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:21.040
he became the master
of Fallen Shisan Tower,

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:22.770
rising to power in the jianghu.

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:25.740
The sixth prince of the former dynasty,

00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:26.700
Chai Xijin.

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:31.460
Back then,

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:33.980
when I exchanged the Jeweled Relic Stupa

00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:35.150
for Chi Yun,

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:37.180
I'd already taken notice.

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:38.860
Plus, with Shen's

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:40.590
Seven-Treasure Jade Hairpin,

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:42.120
the items you requested

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:43.870
were both palace treasures.

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:45.750
Ordinary folks

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:47.430
in the jianghu

00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:49.790
wouldn't even know what they are.

00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:52.030
However,

00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:53.430
I am...

00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:56.630
the godson of Minister Tang,

00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:58.940
so I can access

00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:01.940
some secret palace documents.

00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:09.460
I didn't expect to slip up so soon

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:10.630
and give you leverage

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:11.670
against me.

00:17:12.859 --> 00:17:14.030
Chai Xijin...

00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:17.589
Such a nostalgic name.

00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:19.599
Only what is lost...

00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:22.970
can truly stir nostalgia.

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:24.780
From the Fallen Shisan Tower

00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:27.390
to here,
at the Central Plains Sword Alliance,

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:28.940
your desire for and pursuit of

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:30.200
the Rebirth Scroll...

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:33.340
have been extraordinary.

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:35.390
Is the Rebirth Scroll

00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:37.120
really so important

00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:38.640
to you

00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:41.470
that it's worth obtaining

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:43.840
by any means necessary?

00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:44.810
Of course.

00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:47.190
The Rebirth Scroll is now

00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:48.510
the ultimate martial art,

00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:50.170
transcending all other arts.

00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:52.050
You yourself have relied on it

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:53.640
to become nearly invincible in the world.

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:54.970
Who wouldn't desire it?

00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:55.900
But that's also

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:57.560
Yique Yinyang's martial art.

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:00.500
Yique Yinyang caused
your dynasty's downfall.

00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:03.110
Why would you want to learn
his martial art?

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:08.690
You're such a nag.

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:10.780
Master Liu from Fengliu Shop

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.760
wouldn't ask so many questions.

00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:16.800
Imagine if people knew

00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:18.300
that Shisan Tower actually

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:20.120
belongs to a prince of the former dynasty

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:21.250
and that this prince

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.310
is colluding with Fengliu Shop,

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:25.310
which holds the Blood Ghost Pill...

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:27.200
they...

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:28.190
What are they talking about?

00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:28.920
I don't know.

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:30.250
I can't hear either.

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:34.620
They'd rather leave Fengliu Shop alone

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:36.730
and wipe out your Shisan Tower first.

00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:40.690
Chief Fang,

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:42.640
you should understand

00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:44.710
that you're only safe

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:46.350
in the darkness.

00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:48.140
Mr. Tang.

00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:52.540
You just said the most dangerous thing.

00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:53.820
Dangerous?

00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:57.710
Your methods against me

00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:59.240
are no different.

00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:00.510
But

00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:02.710
judging from your expression now,

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:04.860
it seems my threat

00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:06.660
carries more weight.

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:13.270
Chief Fang,

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:15.470
you've had your fun.

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:17.030
Won't you leave now?

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:19.030
But if I obtain

00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:20.820
the eternal Rebirth Scroll,

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:22.140
I'll gain

00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:23.230
a mysterious

00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:25.100
and powerful body like yours.

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:26.680
I'll obtain the path

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:28.110
from human to god.

00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:30.620
I want to obtain

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:31.590
the path

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:33.280
from human to god.

00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:35.550
Work with me.

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:38.240
You want to become a god?

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:39.060
If you don't,

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:40.300
that's your problem.

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:47.750
Fang Pingzhai, Chief of

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:49.410
Fallen Shisan Tower, is here.

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:51.310
He's the Chief of Shisan Tower?

00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:55.250
The Chief has another identity,

00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:56.310
which is...

00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:57.030
Fine.

00:19:58.720 --> 00:19:59.420
You win.

00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:00.520
I'll leave.

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:04.100
Sorry to have troubled you
these past few days,

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:05.210
and thanks for your hospitality.

00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:07.210
I, Fang Pingzhai, never owe favors.

00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:07.860
Before I leave,

00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:09.420
I'll give you all a special gift

00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:10.820
to express my gratitude!

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:18.310
Is he for real?

00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:19.380
Follow him.

00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:25.270
For how long?

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:26.950
Until you feel that
if you don't come back,

00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:28.740
he'll bring disaster upon the world.

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:29.910
The key is to find out

00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:31.650
what his true purpose is.

00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:32.940
That important?

00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:36.010
You can count on me.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:44.660
The Peony Pavilion!

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:46.520
The one we've been searching for!

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:48.550
It really is.

00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:51.140
Isn't Xiuyu Peony Pavilion

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:53.070
the headquarters of Fengliu Shop?

00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:54.190
This map is so detailed.

00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:55.390
It doesn't look fake.

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:00.360
It even shows the corridors.

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:01.480
Is this real or fake?

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:03.740
Now wiping them out will be child's play!

00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:12.790
When was this map put up?

00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:16.860
Turns out the headquarters of Fengliu Shop

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:19.230
has been hidden
in the misty marshlands all along.

00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:20.910
Jiangnan's waters are
full of isolated islands.

00:21:20.910 --> 00:21:23.110
No wonder we couldn't find it anywhere.

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:24.580
Sword Master, please

00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:26.750
send orders to all disciples immediately

00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:29.150
to attack the Xiuyu Peony Pavilion
at once.

00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:31.080
Since the Peony Pavilion is

00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:33.270
the headquarters of Fengliu Shop,

00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:35.340
it must be full of traps and mechanisms.

00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:36.550
Whether we can trust this map

00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:37.610
remains to be seen.

00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:38.900
We should first send someone

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:40.370
to infiltrate and investigate

00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:42.510
to avoid falling into the enemy's trap.

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:44.710
Traps and mechanisms are mere trickery.

00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:45.580
Once our forces are assembled,

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:46.550
brute force will overcome any trick!

00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:47.750
Whatever traps they set,

00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:48.620
we'll crush them all!

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:49.550
With Mr. Tang

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:50.980
and so many experts from our alliance,

00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:51.950
plus backing from the imperial court

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:52.950
and Biluo Palace,

00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:54.140
there's no need to hold back!

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:55.710
Our alliance is at its strongest

00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:56.710
with high morale.

00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:58.440
If not now, when?

00:21:58.900 --> 00:21:59.750
Master Cheng,

00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:00.750
what do you think?

00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:03.060
Evil must be thoroughly eliminated
sooner rather than later.

00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:04.190
I have no objection.

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:10.260
-Please issue the order, Sword Master.
-Please issue the order, Sword Master.

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:12.140
Relay my command:

00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:15.360
assemble the disciples from all halls

00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:16.940
and prepare for battle!

00:22:21.770 --> 00:22:22.740
Mr. Tang,

00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:24.140
what do you think about that map?

00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:25.820
How much can it be trusted?

00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:27.240
At this point,

00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:28.380
with everyone's blood running hot,

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:30.620
does it even matter
whether it's real or fake?

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:31.420
That's true.

00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:34.030
But the alliance still needs time to
come together.

00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:35.520
Whoever posted this map

00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:37.550
deliberately wants to deny us that time.

00:22:37.550 --> 00:22:38.750
I'm worried another faction

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:40.420
is entering the game,

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:43.240
determined to disrupt
the peace of the jianghu.

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:44.440
What matters most now

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:47.780
is how to win the battle
against the Peony Pavilion.

00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:49.700
After the battle,

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:50.510
I'll

00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:52.140
personally resolve

00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:53.010
this matter.

00:22:59.190 --> 00:22:59.900
Master,

00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:01.420
I have some thoughts

00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:02.340
about the coming battle

00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:04.200
that I'd like to discuss with you.

00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:06.720
Chunji,

00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:08.720
didn't I tell you to go back?

00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:11.640
When will we attack Fengliu Shop?

00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:13.040
I want to be in the vanguard,

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:14.700
charging into battle for you!

00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:18.550
I'm already asleep.

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:20.390
Let's discuss it tomorrow.

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:29.270
Master Shao,

00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:30.510
I'll

00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:32.510
take my leave now.

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:33.660
Mr. Tang,

00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:35.380
please help me talk some sense into

00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:37.380
that troublesome disciple of mine.

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:49.680
Earlier, Mr. Tang,

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:52.530
you told me to wait
until the final battle.

00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:54.080
I can't wait any longer.

00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:55.820
Ms. Zhong,

00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:58.580
you've always been a strong-willed person.

00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:01.100
Yes.

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:03.340
I'm very strong-willed.

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:06.700
Why should anyone admit defeat?

00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:08.360
But strong-willed people

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:09.550
often have...

00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:13.140
fragile hearts.

00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:16.320
The most strong-willed person I know

00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:18.070
seems to be you, Mr. Tang.

00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:22.000
Therefore,

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:23.320
I

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:25.480
can understand how you feel.

00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:30.950
I

00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:33.360
just want to remind you:

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:36.650
the closer you are to your goal,

00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:38.090
the calmer you must stay.

00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:39.850
To lose patience

00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:42.080
is often to lose one's way,

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:43.240
and you may

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:45.490
be exploited by enemies

00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:47.860
or even

00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:50.270
fall into their traps.

00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:57.660
I understand.

00:24:58.870 --> 00:24:59.710
Then I'll...

00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:01.580
go back and think carefully about

00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:02.510
the battle plan.

00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:07.140
Goodbye.

00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:08.640
Goodbye.

00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:34.070
What's wrong, Master Puzhu?

00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:35.750
We're approaching the outpost.

00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:37.410
We must proceed with caution.

00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:39.340
I'll scout ahead first.

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:40.790
You all remain here for now.

00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:42.190
Thank you, Master Puzhu.

00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:47.230
Before I return,

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:49.300
don't make any rash moves.

00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:50.390
Understood.

00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:57.620
Rest in place!

00:25:58.030 --> 00:25:59.230
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:00.780
Come on, let's go sit over there.

00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:01.440
Alright, let's go.

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:03.100
Come on, let's sit over there.

00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:39.230
My friend,

00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:40.910
it's been a long time.

00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:42.970
You...

00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:46.100
I'm not wearing a veil,

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:47.930
and you don't recognize me anymore?

00:26:47.930 --> 00:26:48.530
My friend,

00:26:49.030 --> 00:26:49.750
I

00:26:49.810 --> 00:26:51.340
came to play chess with you.

00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:54.050
Whether you wear a veil or not,

00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:55.020
I've

00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:57.390
never truly seen you clearly.

00:26:57.510 --> 00:26:58.910
For instance, right now,

00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:01.220
should I address you as Miss Tao

00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:03.260
or as "The Peach of Three Hues,"

00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:04.230
Xifang Tao?

00:27:12.170 --> 00:27:13.430
The Peach of Three Hues

00:27:13.910 --> 00:27:14.630
is me.

00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:16.340
Miss Tao

00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:17.330
is also me.

00:27:18.790 --> 00:27:19.550
Isn't it said

00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:21.470
that all that has form is false?

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:25.500
Sir, you've studied
the Buddhist scriptures deeply,

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:26.700
so why cling to forms?

00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:29.840
Sir,

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:30.960
please.

00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:40.030
For today's game,

00:27:40.030 --> 00:27:42.760
let's play blindfolded chess
with this endgame.

00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:43.990
What do you think?

00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:45.350
Let it be so.

00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:47.140
This string of beads of mine

00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:48.340
has exactly 13 beads.

00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:50.660
So, Sir,

00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:52.720
I shall play only 13 moves.

00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:01.850
In that case...

00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:04.670
I'll make the first move.

00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:45.870
Let me borrow your prayer bead.

00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:52.030
All this time, I've been wondering

00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:54.090
whether I should consider you
a chess companion

00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:55.090
or an opponent.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.320
It's time to decide now.

00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:01.670
Light Technique—

00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:04.640
Stars Scattered Across the Sky!

00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:08.350
I've played chess with you
for three years.

00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:09.640
I remember every move

00:29:09.670 --> 00:29:10.510
you ever made.

00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:12.420
There are several positions

00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:14.140
where you never placed your pieces,

00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:15.420
even though, according to chess theory,

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:16.350
you should have.

00:29:17.670 --> 00:29:18.500
My friend,

00:29:19.090 --> 00:29:21.150
are you deliberately letting me win?

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:22.660
I guess

00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:23.930
those positions

00:29:24.730 --> 00:29:25.550
are the formation cores

00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:28.280
that trigger
the Stars Scattered Across the Sky!

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:39.030
Oh no.

00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:43.440
Deputy Lord Yu,

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:44.510
what should we do now?

00:29:44.510 --> 00:29:45.470
To force Master Puzhu to use

00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:46.950
the Stars Scattered Across the Sky,

00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:48.240
that person must be an expert.

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:49.560
Master Puzhu is in danger.

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:50.580
Follow me to aid him!

00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:51.780
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:08.290
You're trying to lure them

00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:09.760
into coming to the rescue?

00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:12.140
That's right.

00:30:12.170 --> 00:30:14.110
I can't be certain I'll defeat you,

00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:16.780
but severely wounding the elites
of the Central Plains Sword Alliance

00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:17.780
is much easier.

00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:19.460
Oh no, it's a trap.

00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:21.760
This is Fengliu Shop's poisonous mist.

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:23.020
Everyone, be careful!

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:28.690
Because of your one careless move,

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:30.920
an entire squad will be sacrificed.

00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:32.740
Do you feel any remorse?

00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:37.310
This poisonous mist suppresses
inner strength.

00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:38.770
I must get them out of here.

00:30:38.850 --> 00:30:39.850
Light Technique—

00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:40.740
Verbal Dharma.

00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:56.240
You'd give up your protective prayer beads

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:57.370
just to save others.

00:31:00.690 --> 00:31:02.890
You're still as compassionate as ever.

00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:11.230
These are Master Puzhu's prayer beads.

00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:12.270
They can guide us

00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:13.200
out of this mist!

00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:13.900
Then...

00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:15.200
let's retreat now.

00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:16.180
Master Puzhu,

00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:17.250
please be careful!

00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:18.470
Stay alert

00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:19.790
and retreat immediately!

00:31:19.790 --> 00:31:20.450
-Yes!
-Yes!

00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:48.260
Your Fengliu Shop is doomed,

00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:49.520
and you've got nowhere to run.

00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:51.050
Why create more bloodshed?

00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:53.800
The Peach of Three Hues—

00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:55.990
Boundless Peach Blossoms!

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:03.350
Lion's Roar.

00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:23.810
Not only will I create bloodshed,

00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:25.630
but I'll also make you

00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:27.340
create bloodshed.

00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:57.140
I

00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:58.490
will never let you die.

00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:04.820
You are truly interesting, Sir.

00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:24.100
We've been walking from dawn till dusk.

00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:25.360
We finally made it out.

00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:26.030
Indeed.

00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:26.950
If it weren't for

00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:28.380
Master Puzhu's prayer beads,

00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:29.060
our losses

00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:30.590
would have been much worse.

00:33:33.010 --> 00:33:34.140
You all head back to camp first.

00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:35.580
I'm going back for Master Puzhu.

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:36.310
You mustn't.

00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:37.420
Deputy Lord Yu,

00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:38.640
it's too dangerous to go back now.

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:39.310
-Yes.
-Yes!

00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:39.660
You mustn't.

00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:40.140
It's far too dangerous!

00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:40.870
Listen to me!

00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:42.560
Not repaying kindness

00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:43.990
violates the ancestral teachings
of Sword King City.

00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:45.230
You should go back quickly.

00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:45.690
Well...

00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:46.880
This is an order.

00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:48.860
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:03.140
Yu Furen,

00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:05.470
you've truly disappointed me.

00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:24.239
Who's there?

00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:40.389
Is it really you?

00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:43.050
You're not dead?

00:34:43.630 --> 00:34:44.739
Yes, I died.

00:34:45.739 --> 00:34:48.540
But Fengliu Shop has turned me into
a human puppet.

00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:49.460
So...

00:34:50.650 --> 00:34:51.860
I came back to life.

00:34:57.070 --> 00:34:57.790
So

00:34:58.220 --> 00:34:59.230
it's true that you've been

00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:01.430
working for Fengliu Shop all this time.

00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:05.150
Then

00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:08.660
you don't deserve to
return to Sword King City now.

00:35:09.070 --> 00:35:10.460
Don't be so harsh.

00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:11.820
Fengliu Shop and I

00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:13.280
are just using each other.

00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:16.670
When did you

00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:18.400
start taking those Evil Pills?

00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:20.960
Who cares about something like that?

00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:23.310
I care!

00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:27.230
I want to know—

00:35:28.030 --> 00:35:29.340
when did

00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:31.340
the hero of Sword King City

00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:32.500
become a monster?

00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:33.940
And when

00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:36.710
did I

00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:38.490
start stubbornly believing in you

00:35:38.490 --> 00:35:40.550
and miss the chance to bring you back?

00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:42.380
You're still as naive as ever.

00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:44.930
There are no heroes who don't pay a price.

00:35:45.070 --> 00:35:45.940
As for you,

00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:48.270
you trusted the wrong person before,

00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:50.270
and you're still doing the same now!

00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:03.520
Come back to the Sword Alliance with me
to face justice!

00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:33.310
You're no match for me.

00:36:34.170 --> 00:36:35.900
Why risk your life fighting me?

00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:38.080
It's a worthless life anyway.

00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:39.540
Risking it...

00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:43.310
What's there to regret?

00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:45.540
Come on!

00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:47.590
You shouldn't die here.

00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:49.630
Go back to Sword King City and learn

00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:51.230
how to be a good city lord

00:36:52.070 --> 00:36:54.820
to protect Sword King City's
century-old legacy.

00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:56.220
Don't you find your words

00:36:56.230 --> 00:36:57.310
laughable?

00:36:58.710 --> 00:36:59.710
If Sword King City

00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:01.190
truly mattered to you,

00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:04.560
how could you have ended up
where you are today?

00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:08.000
I just wanted to be a hero.

00:37:08.490 --> 00:37:09.900
But when ordinary people try to be heroes,

00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:11.230
they must pay a price.

00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:12.930
This price is something

00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:14.980
you'll have to bear sooner or later.

00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:17.230
A hero?

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:21.090
A hero who risks his life
for Fengliu Shop?

00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:26.020
Yu Qifeng,

00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:28.360
I won't believe

00:37:29.110 --> 00:37:30.770
a single word you say anymore.

00:37:31.110 --> 00:37:33.640
Whether you believe it or not
doesn't matter.

00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:34.790
But your price

00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:35.990
is already on its way.

00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:37.460
The person you trust now

00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:39.590
has already decided that fate for you.

00:37:40.270 --> 00:37:40.860
Who?

00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:42.590
Tang Lici?

00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:44.170
I never trusted him.

00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:45.500
You don't trust him, yet you

00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:46.630
obey his every word,

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:48.670
allowing him to command you.

00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:50.380
You lead the people of Sword King City

00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:51.710
to fight his battles!

00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:54.910
I never did it for him.

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:57.240
I did it to destroy Fengliu Shop!

00:37:57.820 --> 00:37:58.860
His methods may be questionable,

00:37:58.860 --> 00:37:59.990
but they often work.

00:38:00.310 --> 00:38:01.230
With him in the Sword Alliance,

00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:02.660
we can eliminate evil forces sooner.

00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:03.980
If Fengliu Shop and the Sword Alliance

00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:05.210
don't destroy each other,

00:38:05.210 --> 00:38:06.990
how could he, as Yique Yinyang,

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:08.830
reap the benefits?

00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:10.530
Yique Yinyang is dead.

00:38:11.310 --> 00:38:11.940
Fengliu Shop

00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:13.460
deliberately framed him

00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:14.460
to provoke conflict in the jianghu...

00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:16.230
Is Fengliu Shop intentionally framing him,

00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:18.520
or are you people from the Sword Alliance
deceiving yourselves?

00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:19.950
Do you know how he obtained

00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:21.080
his Rebirth Scroll?

00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:23.460
Have you seen
his golden eyes and forehead mark?

00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:24.860
He has so many secrets,

00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:26.440
yet why does everyone
in the Sword Alliance

00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:28.050
choose to turn a blind eye?

00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:29.230
I haven't!

00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:31.110
I just...

00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:32.990
I just...

00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:37.420
Everyone has

00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:38.480
their own secrets.

00:38:39.310 --> 00:38:40.670
I'm also waiting for an opportunity.

00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:42.190
I'm afraid some secrets

00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:43.720
are too much for you to bear.

00:38:43.870 --> 00:38:45.600
Shao Yanping has grown senile.

00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:46.820
If he wants to stake the fate
of the entire alliance,

00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:47.690
I can't stop him.

00:38:47.690 --> 00:38:48.950
But you're different.

00:38:49.050 --> 00:38:51.230
You're the next lord of Sword King City.

00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:52.110
Who you trust

00:38:52.450 --> 00:38:54.050
determines the city's fate.

00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:54.940
Furen,

00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:56.520
my life is already ruined,

00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:58.160
but your life has just begun.

00:38:58.590 --> 00:38:59.820
Don't let your life

00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:01.590
and Sword King City's century-old legacy

00:39:01.590 --> 00:39:03.920
become the price of your misplaced trust!

00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:04.800
No matter what,

00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:07.060
you must provide evidence.

00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:08.630
Come back to the alliance with me

00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:10.760
and confront Tang Lici face-to-face.

00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:19.390
So you're saying

00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:20.380
that Master Puzhu

00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:21.750
fell into the trap set by

00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:22.830
the West Palace Chief of Fengliu Shop.

00:39:22.830 --> 00:39:24.760
After getting separated from you
in the mist,

00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:26.460
there's been no trace of him since?

00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:26.940
Yes.

00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:28.680
It's all my fault.

00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:30.760
Before Master Puzhu left,

00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:32.020
he clearly instructed me

00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:33.070
not to act rashly.

00:39:34.610 --> 00:39:36.270
But I still acted recklessly.

00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:38.440
That enchantress is full of tricks.

00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:39.540
It's no surprise

00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:41.090
that you fell into her trap.

00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:43.270
Unfortunately, after we entered the mist,

00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:44.310
we couldn't tell which way to go

00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:45.390
and didn't know

00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:47.630
where Master Puzhu had gone
while chasing Xifang Tao.

00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:49.090
But I imagine Master Puzhu

00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:49.980
must have had some other method

00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:51.020
to find his way.

00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:52.890
Otherwise,

00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:54.070
he wouldn't have given this prayer bead

00:39:54.070 --> 00:39:54.590
to us.

00:39:57.680 --> 00:39:59.210
Let me see this prayer bead.

00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:25.120
After you fought your way out,

00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:26.270
did you encounter

00:40:26.270 --> 00:40:27.000
anyone else?

00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:41.740
No.

00:40:46.090 --> 00:40:47.010
I can tell

00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:48.690
he's hiding something.

00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:50.420
Indeed.

00:40:51.610 --> 00:40:52.710
Then, who do you think

00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:53.640
he encountered?

00:40:55.450 --> 00:40:57.540
It takes the one who started it to end it.

00:40:57.540 --> 00:40:59.450
To unravel Commander Yu's inner conflict,

00:40:59.450 --> 00:41:00.780
we can only wait and see.

00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:02.190
The same goes

00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:03.820
for Master Puzhu.

00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:05.330
What do you mean?

00:41:05.710 --> 00:41:07.340
There was a note

00:41:07.670 --> 00:41:09.000
at Master Puzhu's place

00:41:09.230 --> 00:41:10.310
saying

00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:12.650
that his chess companion of many years

00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:14.750
is the West Palace Chief of Fengliu Shop,

00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:15.820
Xifang Tao.

00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:18.020
Master Puzhu

00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:19.680
is not a gullible man.

00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:21.150
For them to become friends,

00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:22.410
there must be a reason.

00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:23.810
Perhaps...

00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:28.360
because they've known each other
for a long time...

00:41:29.710 --> 00:41:30.460
things

00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:31.630
won't reach

00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:32.940
the worst outcome.

00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:34.580
On the contrary...

00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:40.880
it may help Puzhu overcome
his karmic obstacles.

00:42:39.050 --> 00:42:42.050
You actually used your remaining strength
to save me.

00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:43.760
Master Puzhu,

00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:46.440
what are you really thinking?

00:42:48.310 --> 00:42:49.310
I said

00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:52.430
I'd never let you die because of me.

00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:54.590
You won't kill me,

00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:57.340
but I'll kill you.

00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:01.200
You're badly injured now.

00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:03.120
Don't act recklessly.

00:43:05.790 --> 00:43:07.980
I know how badly I'm injured.

00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:17.900
Messenger geese.

00:43:30.070 --> 00:43:30.870
Master Puzhu,

00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:32.940
why don't you ask

00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:34.340
the Yanmen Sect for help?

00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:36.440
They can't hear us.

00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:39.690
The terrain here is unique—

00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:41.260
wide at the bottom, narrow at the top,

00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:42.810
and surrounded by steep cliffs.

00:43:42.810 --> 00:43:44.470
It wouldn't be easy to find us.

00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:49.230
You're injured now.

00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:52.280
It's impossible for you to leave.

00:43:53.710 --> 00:43:54.820
It seems I

00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:57.670
have fallen into your hands.

00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:11.540
Master Puzhu,

00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:14.540
the fact that you still had strength left
to save me...

00:44:14.970 --> 00:44:16.150
means that this place

00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:17.500
can't trap you at all.

00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:19.550
Sir,

00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:21.510
why don't you leave?

00:44:22.750 --> 00:44:24.830
West Palace Chief, since you're awake,

00:44:24.830 --> 00:44:25.670
please get up.

00:44:27.330 --> 00:44:28.530
"West Palace Chief"?

00:44:43.510 --> 00:44:44.770
Sir, you're sweating.

00:44:45.810 --> 00:44:47.610
Is it because you're exhausted,

00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:49.860
or because...

00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:53.790
you're nervous?

00:44:56.140 --> 00:44:57.410
You're pressing on my legs.
