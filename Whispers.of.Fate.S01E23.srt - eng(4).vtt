[Whispers of Fate]

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:29.950
[Episode 23]

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.570
Sir, you're sweating.

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.450
Is it because you're exhausted,

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:38.810
or because...

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:42.720
you're nervous?

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.610
You're pressing on my legs.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.440
You broke your leg?

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.170
Why didn't you push me away?

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:08.639
You're injured.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.010
I was afraid of hurting you again.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.290
You don't have to force yourself.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.090
Are we going to starve to death here?

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:25.520
Or...

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.980
Master Puzhu, do you think

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.150
dying together with me,
the West Palace Chief

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.120
of Fengliu Shop,

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.600
would stain your reputation?

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.750
I won't die.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.200
And neither will you.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.570
I'll go find something to eat.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.280
Master Puzhu,

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.170
do you eat meat?

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.820
Master Puzhu hasn't returned yet.

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:31.160
The Sword Alliance has lost a major force.

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.030
Not just that.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.910
Aside from this map,

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.560
which might not even be real,

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.710
we know nothing

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.610
about this Xiuyu Peony Pavilion.

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:39.360
And they know nothing

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.360
about us either.

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:41.400
They also want to know

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.360
how many weapons,

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.360
how many supplies,

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.840
and

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.760
how many experts we have.

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:50.310
Tomorrow,

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.280
send disciples good at lightness skill

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.030
to scout

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.530
and pretend to be alone.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.060
Then have Master Shangguan

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.590
lead a team to lie in ambush from behind,

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.310
draw out the people of Fengliu Shop,

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.840
and capture them for questioning.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.640
Leave it to me.

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.710
Master Pu,

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.680
how's the antidote

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:05.430
I asked you to prepare?

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.160
Don't worry.

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.190
If I can't make it, I'll never call myself

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.520
the Poison Saint again.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:16.890
Master Shao,

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.190
Sword Masters...

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.600
Mr. Tang.

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.670
Our ship from Sword King City has arrived.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.840
Everyone,

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:33.920
in this operation against Fengliu Shop,

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:34.630
everyone

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:36.600
must follow the plan.

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.510
No unauthorized actions.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:39.870
No going in alone.

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:43.000
Yes!

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.310
Mr. Yu,

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.300
do you have any questions?

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:52.390
No.

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:59.930
Mr. Tang, bad news.

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.050
Something's wrong.

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:06.310
Senior Zhong,

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:07.830
can we really do this?

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.870
Mr. Tang said

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.430
we must not leave the group
without authorization.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:12.560
But Master also said

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.280
someone needs to scout ahead

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.040
to verify whether the map is real.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.830
If we can find

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.030
useful information,

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.310
it will help the Sword Alliance.

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.040
Back at Shanfeng Branch,

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.390
it was always you leading us.

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:24.250
After you left,

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:25.680
no one ever gave us
important assignments again.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.140
We were almost reduced to doing chores.

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:29.000
When I return to Shanfeng Branch,

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.190
I won't let

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:31.250
this happen again.

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:39.040
Let me tell you.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.240
Last time I led a team,

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.510
-Hide!
-and caught several of them.

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:42.000
Really?

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:43.659
That's impressive.

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:45.270
We got several boxes of treasures.

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:46.920
I'll take you along next time.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:47.680
Great.

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:48.610
No problem.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:54.310
Let's go!

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:00.040
Follow them!

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.570
Let's go!

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:01.070
Hurry!

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.800
Strange.

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:14.470
They're not moving fast.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.330
Why can't we catch up with them?

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:38.640
Something's wrong.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.050
Everyone, retreat!

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.650
Since you're here already,

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:51.020
why retreat?

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:53.070
It's him?

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:54.780
Everyone, run!

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:57.200
Split up and run in different directions!

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.310
Blood Begonias,

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:06.200
bloom.

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:19.420
There's no escape.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.190
He's toying with us.

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:23.510
This has nothing to do with them.

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:24.710
You didn't kill them,

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:26.560
which proves your target is me!

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:27.240
Let them go!

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:34.880
Dr. Liu!

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:35.750
Master,

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:37.040
this is Dr. Liu.

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:40.500
I'm in a good mood today.

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:42.159
If you come over yourself,

00:07:42.159 --> 00:07:43.310
I'll let them go.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.480
You, the mighty head of Fengliu Shop,

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.890
actually don't keep your word?

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:18.010
Unlike Tang Lici,

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:19.430
I always keep my word.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.070
Seven days after the flowers wither,

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:22.020
the poison will wear off,

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:23.820
and they'll wake up on their own.

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:25.820
However,

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:30.190
you...

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:31.870
know me?

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:35.799
Let me formally introduce myself.

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:37.700
My name is Liu Yan.

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:46.360
Senior Zhong!

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:47.360
Senior Zhong!

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:48.460
Senior Zhong!

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:49.390
Zhong!

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:50.360
-Heroine!
-Senior Zhong!

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.200
Zhong!

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.360
-Ms. Zhong!
-Senior Zhong!

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:54.480
-Search carefully!
-Zhong!

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:54.960
Gu.

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:56.510
Earlier,

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.240
a strange thick fog appeared here.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.650
The wild geese wouldn't come near.

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:00.690
One of my disciples

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:02.240
saw from a distance,
riding on a wild goose,

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:03.200
that Ms. Zhong

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:05.470
was coming this way with people.

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:07.080
Gu!

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:08.670
Yu!

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:09.750
Yu.

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:10.920
Master Jiang.

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:12.550
Yu, you're finally here.

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:13.150
We still

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:14.350
haven't found Zhong.

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:16.080
I'm afraid something happened to her.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:16.950
Don't worry yet.

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:18.270
We'll definitely find her.

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:19.000
Let's split up and search.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:19.530
Alright.

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:20.200
Let's go!

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:21.630
Everyone, spread out

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:22.360
and search carefully!

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:23.720
-Look carefully!
-Zhong!

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:24.520
Senior Zhong!

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:25.200
Follow me this way!

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.360
-Senior Zhong! Senior Zhong!
-Zhong!

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:28.630
Senior Zhong!

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.120
Senior Zhong!

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.150
Senior Zhong!

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:33.550
Senior Zhong!

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.630
Senior Zhong!

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:42.030
Zhong!

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:43.790
Zhong!

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:45.840
Zhong!

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:47.910
Not her.

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:49.080
Zhong!

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:50.390
Zhong!

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:53.070
There are drag marks here.

00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:54.120
-It looks like Fengliu Shop
-Zhong!

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.180
dragged them here.

00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:56.480
Zhong!

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:57.120
Gu!

00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:58.670
Gu!

00:09:59.030 --> 00:09:59.440
Zhong!

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:01.150
Zhong's not here!

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:02.050
Don't panic.

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:03.550
Master Jiang.

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:04.810
Look at this.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:06.860
Don't touch it.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.770
It should be a curse bug.

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:18.810
Take it back

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:21.170
and have Mr. Tang identify it.

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:22.690
It's Liu Yan!

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:25.260
Liu Yan is skilled at using curse bugs!

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:25.810
So,

00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:26.920
Ms. Zhong

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.920
might have been taken by Liu Yan?

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.000
Mr. Tang,

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:37.590
what should we do now?

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:39.190
[Man on earth, good at birth.]

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.030
First, call back the search team.

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:43.320
Then how are we supposed
to rescue Ms. Zhong?

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:45.030
Liu Yan only took Ms. Zhong

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:46.200
as a hostage.

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:47.670
He won't kill her now.

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:49.720
Liu Yan uses curse bugs
with deadly precision.

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.120
Disciples affected by the Blood Begonias

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:52.270
need 7 days to wake;

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:53.600
if forced awake,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:54.960
they'll die.

00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:57.310
This is a challenge from Liu Yan.

00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:58.390
What does it mean?

00:10:58.870 --> 00:10:59.800
A life for a life.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.390
Seven days is the deadline.

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:03.720
If we can't rescue Ms. Zhong
within 7 days,

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:05.440
the disciples will survive,

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:06.600
and she will die.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:07.760
That's right.

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:08.740
Seven days—

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:14.670
that's the challenge I set for them.

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:18.480
I don't understand.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.000
Master, why did you

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:20.930
give them 7 days?

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:22.900
If we attack first,

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:25.010
the initiative is in their hands.

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:26.830
But by setting a challenge

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:27.860
with a deadline,

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:29.720
people get anxious,

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:30.790
afraid,

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:31.720
and they stall.

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:33.780
For life-and-death matters,

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:35.960
people will wait
until the last moment to decide,

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.960
and the initiative will swing back to us.

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:38.790
Seven days

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.490
is enough to create cracks among them.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:45.510
I see.

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:48.360
Whether they decide in the end

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:49.670
to save her or not,

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:52.910
the unity Tang Lici wants

00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:54.780
will be broken.

00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:59.330
The Sword Alliance's biggest problem

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:00.990
is its internal instability,

00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:04.030
with no binding interests
and only empty talk of justice.

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:04.960
We'll start

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:06.360
with their disagreements,

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:07.220
pry them apart,

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:08.450
and let the alliance

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:09.820
collapse from within.

00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:28.870
Master,

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:29.720
I'm back.

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:34.600
Chunji, you're back.

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:36.760
You did a great job on this recon

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:38.360
of Xiuyu Peony Pavilion.

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:41.030
You made a great contribution
to the Sword Alliance.

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:42.390
Even Mr. Tang says

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:44.200
that without Ms. Zhong,

00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:47.150
we'd have had no chance
of winning this battle.

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:48.620
This is simply my duty.

00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:50.550
Those 6 Sword Masters,

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:52.790
hearing you faced Liu Yan's brutal torture

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:54.080
with unflinching courage

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:56.000
and defended the Sword Alliance's honor,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:56.670
were utterly

00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:57.840
impressed.

00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:59.240
They all begged me

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:00.390
to immediately restore you

00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:02.190
as the Chief of Shanfeng Branch.

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.280
Looks like this time,

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:06.150
you finally made it through.

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:35.160
It's been 3 days.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.400
How long can you hold out?

00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:39.440
Just...

00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:41.480
kill me.

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:43.220
This time,

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:45.510
are you serious?

00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:48.040
I don't want to kill you.

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:51.420
I deliberately set a trap to catch you.

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:53.120
If I let you die easily,

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:54.660
what would be the point?

00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:55.830
Think about it—

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.630
the top heroine among the righteous sects,

00:13:57.630 --> 00:13:58.430
Zhong Chunji,

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:01.230
the beloved disciple of Shao Yanping
of the Central Plains Sword Alliance,

00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:03.080
out of selfishness and recklessness,

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.920
drags everyone to their deaths

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:07.340
and ends up
the target of the world's scorn.

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:09.270
What a splendid drama.

00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:11.270
No.

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:17.300
You won't succeed.

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:25.120
My master

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:29.010
will surely see through your plot.

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:30.800
He won't...

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:32.440
What?

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:34.670
He won't come to save you?

00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:36.510
Wouldn't that be even sadder?

00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:38.480
Ms. Zhong,

00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:42.330
you truly are
Master Shao's beloved disciple.

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:43.730
You know him well.

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:46.670
The Central Plains Sword Alliance
will surely attack

00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:47.930
Xiuyu Peony Pavilion,

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:49.730
but a well-prepared attack

00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:51.510
is completely different

00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:52.870
from a rash one

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:54.700
launched just to save you.

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:56.970
Shao Yanping is a smart man.

00:14:57.540 --> 00:14:58.800
Sacrificing your life

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:01.120
to save the Sword Alliance
from major losses

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:02.520
is too good a deal for him.

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:03.910
Anyway,

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:06.800
it's simply because
you're not worth enough.

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:09.320
Tang Lici is involved
in the Zhoudi Tower case,

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:10.390
yet Shao Yanping

00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:11.200
showed him mercy

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.490
and even honored him as the Guest of Honor
of the Sword Alliance.

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:13.550
But what about you?

00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:15.510
The great heroine Zhong Chunji,

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:17.000
Chief of Shanfeng Branch—

00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:18.440
all of these titles

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:19.470
are his reward to you.

00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:20.480
None of them

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:21.720
truly belongs to you.

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:23.200
That's why you fight so hard

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:24.000
to defend him,

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:26.150
because you know, without him,

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:27.600
you are nothing.

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:31.750
You...

00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:34.730
are too weak.

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:38.200
If you think I'm so worthless,

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:40.920
then why waste your breath?

00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:42.030
Kill me already!

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:43.600
I'm standing up for you.

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:48.100
After all you've done
for the Sword Alliance,

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:50.360
they still won't make a single sacrifice

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:51.600
for you.

00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:57.830
Who am I, Zhong Chunji,

00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:01.270
to make a monster like you

00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:03.030
pity me, Master?

00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:10.320
In your heart,

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.600
there's also a monster.

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:15.280
Otherwise, how would you

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:16.480
have acted on your own

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:18.570
and fallen right into my trap?

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:20.270
I have one as well.

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:21.440
But I've already

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:22.670
let mine out without shame.

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:23.870
While you, Ms. Zhong,

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:26.050
are still putting on a facade.

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:30.270
Ms. Zhong,

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:32.950
you are just an ordinary person.

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:34.510
Why do you hold yourself

00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:36.040
to the standards of a saint?

00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:40.080
Cry when you want to cry.

00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:42.720
Laugh when you want to laugh.

00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:44.520
When you're afraid,

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:47.630
allow yourself to be afraid.

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:50.100
And when you want something,

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:53.120
reach out and take it.

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:55.600
No rush.

00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:57.120
There are still 4 days.

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:58.630
Ms. Zhong, if you want to die,

00:16:58.630 --> 00:16:59.770
waiting for 4 more days
won't make a difference,

00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:00.240
right?

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:03.570
If you survive these 4 days,

00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:05.000
I'll give you a great gift,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.160
a gift that allows you to cast aside

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:08.030
your identity as Shao Yanping's disciple

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:08.920
and still

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:09.960
command respect.

00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:15.670
You can take a gamble.

Throw them.

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:15.830
From now on,

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:17.030
when you're feeling down

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:17.920
and want to throw something,

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:19.580
throw these iron chopsticks.

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:25.370
Master Shao,

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:27.340
it's time to go to Wanhua Hall.

00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:33.890
Third Brother,

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:35.590
of course we have to fight,

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:36.550
but if we fight now,

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:37.720
we'll fall right into his trap.

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:38.880
Since we're going to fight anyway,

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:40.510
isn't it the same
whether we fight now or later?

00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:41.270
If you ask me,

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:43.020
it's all that girl's fault

00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:44.490
for acting on her own.

00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:47.110
At a time like this,

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:49.110
you're still blaming Ms. Zhong?

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:51.510
Everyone, please calm down.

00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:52.770
Let's talk patiently.

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:53.590
Besides,

00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:54.680
isn't Ms. Zhong's life

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:55.400
a life?

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:57.330
We still have 4 days.

00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:59.410
There's still time to vote.

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:00.050
Right?

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:01.510
We've been arguing for 3 days.

00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:02.780
Have we reached an agreement?

00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:03.420
Master Shao,

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:04.070
Mr. Tang,

00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:04.820
you're here.

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:22.410
It's been 3 days.

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:28.110
Three days of waiting—

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:31.180
I understand how you feel.

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:33.360
Chunji was captured,

00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:34.960
Master Puzhu is missing,

00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:37.550
and the map of the Xiuyu Peony Pavilion—

00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:39.110
all show that Fengliu Shop

00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:40.310
has already set a trap

00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:42.370
and is just waiting for us to fall in.

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:45.640
Zhong Chunji

00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:47.720
is my beloved disciple.

00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:49.700
But every life

00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:51.590
in the Central Plains Sword Alliance

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:52.790
is equally precious.

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:53.830
I...

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:56.830
cannot put everyone at risk

00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:58.090
in this circumstance.

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:01.220
Therefore,

00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:04.830
I have decided

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:08.930
to postpone our attack
on the Peony Pavilion.

00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:10.350
What?

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:16.170
Master Shao,

00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:17.850
while we're thinking

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:19.880
how we won't fall into

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:21.110
Liu Yan's trap,

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:23.360
actually,

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.920
we are already in it.

00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:28.720
Liu Yan

00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:32.480
wants to put us in a dilemma;

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:34.030
he wants us...

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:34.930
Isn't that enough?

00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:36.160
-To argue endlessly...
-At a time like this,

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:37.960
you are still blaming Ms. Zhong?

00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:40.680
And...

00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:46.730
tear ourselves apart.

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:54.640
I consider myself the best in the world.

00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:57.270
The harder something looks

00:21:57.270 --> 00:21:58.400
to have it both ways,

00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:00.670
the more determined I am to achieve it.

00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:03.950
I will not only attack
Xiuyu Peony Pavilion,

00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:05.510
but also rescue Ms. Zhong.

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:15.400
Tang Lici,

00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:17.030
now is not the time

00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:18.360
for you to play the hero.

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:20.160
Don't act impulsively,

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:20.750
Mr. Tang.

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:24.240
I'm not playing the hero

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:25.640
nor acting impulsively.

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:26.800
Master Shao,

00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:29.400
since we've decided
to attack Fengliu Shop,

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:30.160
if we allow delays

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:31.590
simply because

00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:33.370
the plan is disrupted,

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:34.830
the longer we stall,

00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:36.590
the deeper the unrest and suspicion

00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:37.590
within the Sword Alliance

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:38.480
will grow.

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:40.310
They seized one chance

00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:41.160
against us,

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:43.160
so they'll certainly seize

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:44.000
a second.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.260
This is my first point.

00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:47.880
Second,

00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:52.650
Ms. Zhong is Master Shao's disciple.

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:55.140
Master Shao worries that if he

00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:57.000
lets everyone risk themselves
to rescue her,

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.440
he'll put other disciples in danger.

00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:00.840
But what if we look at it
from another angle?

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:03.070
Ms. Zhong is also a disciple
of the Sword Alliance

00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:04.600
and a major force within it.

00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:07.680
If Master Shao won't even rescue

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:08.510
his own disciple,

00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:09.240
what kind of a heartless leader

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:10.400
will he appear to be

00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:12.270
in the eyes

00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:14.800
of the other disciples
in the Sword Alliance?

00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:17.200
Third,

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.400
even if Liu Yan
has set an inescapable trap,

00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:23.160
whether the Sword Alliance takes action
or not,

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:23.760
my friends

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:26.110
and I

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:28.090
will go to Xiuyu Peony Pavilion

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:29.550
to rescue Ms. Zhong—

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:33.550
because

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:36.590
she's one of us.

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:42.830
We are willing to go with you!

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:54.590
Mr. Tang,

00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:57.160
thank you.

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:07.920
I can't do it anymore.

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:09.590
That woman is really tough.

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:11.360
I'll work myself to death

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:12.920
before I kill her.

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:16.280
Thank you for your help,
East Palace Chief.

00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:39.790
Congratulations, Ms. Zhong.

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:42.930
Master sent me to bring you a gift.

00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:15.520
Thank you.

00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:27.780
How many days have we been trapped here?

00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:29.480
Today is the 6th day.

00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:33.070
It's been six days already,

00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:34.530
and no one has found us yet.

00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:36.890
Let me help you.

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:43.630
Sir, don't be so formal.

00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:45.680
Is it good?

00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:49.070
That's the last fruit

00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:50.550
I could pick.

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:53.000
I can't use my inner strength,

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.260
and your leg's broken.

00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:58.100
I want to support you
so we can go look for food together.

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:03.750
Please.

00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:37.680
These fruits

00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:39.030
aren't enough for us.

00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:40.550
Besides,

00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:43.940
I've grown sick
of eating them these past few days.

00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:49.530
Catch a couple of fish.

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:50.920
We can grill them.

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:55.090
I won't eat them.

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:57.140
Miss Tao, please go ahead.

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:02.110
You...

00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:04.060
Fish are lives.

00:27:04.790 --> 00:27:05.960
So am I.

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:08.270
If I starve to death

00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:10.880
because you don't want to kill them,

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:11.940
wouldn't that mean

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:13.750
I die because of you?

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:43.710
Happy now?

00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:49.630
Sir, you're really amusing.

00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:56.110
Much more amusing than

00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:58.040
when we were chess partners.

00:27:58.750 --> 00:27:59.510
Amusing?

00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:03.240
You know once I recover,

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:04.570
you'll be the one to die.

00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:07.200
You're truly...

00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:09.920
amusingly stupid.

00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:12.640
You never actually wanted

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:13.240
to kill me.

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:17.180
Instead,
you've been forcing me to kill you.

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:17.920
Why?

00:28:25.030 --> 00:28:27.350
Do you know what I like, Sir?

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:32.440
I like watching people fall.

00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:35.990
All it takes is a moment's hesitation,

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:38.160
a fleeting thought.

00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:40.480
They could've said no,

00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:43.500
but they couldn't resist temptation.

00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:45.170
And just like that,

00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:48.550
they walk to

00:28:48.550 --> 00:28:50.110
the cliff's edge,

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:53.090
lose their footing,

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:55.370
and fall into an endless abyss,

00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:58.240
never to climb back up,

00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:01.590
never to see the sky again.

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:04.030
Don't you think

00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:05.480
that's amusing?

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:07.440
Captivating.

00:29:09.090 --> 00:29:10.890
Miss Tao, you find this amusing?

00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:12.830
Sir, do you think

00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:14.490
I deserve to die even more now?

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:16.030
I don't think that

00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:19.110
once someone takes a wrong path,

00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:20.670
they can't turn back.

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:26.720
Sir, are you saying

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:28.790
I should turn back

00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:33.510
before it's too late?

00:29:34.510 --> 00:29:35.770
Everyone has desires,

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:39.250
just as the Evil Pill
awakens people's cravings.

00:29:39.450 --> 00:29:40.510
It's never too late

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:42.600
to find your way back.

00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:44.170
Just turn back,

00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:46.230
and you'll see the shore.

00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:14.950
Everyone,

00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:17.870
this attack on Xiuyu Peony Pavilion

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:19.620
will be extremely difficult.

00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:22.000
Everyone must hold their positions

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.060
and follow orders.

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:24.510
We'll infiltrate

00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:26.310
through the northern waterway,

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:28.670
relying primarily
on Master Jiang's Falcon Unit

00:30:28.670 --> 00:30:31.130
for overall observation and early warning.

00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:31.880
Master Shao,

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:32.860
Deputy Lord Yu,

00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:35.420
you'll lead the Leopard Unit
as the vanguard,

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:37.310
breaching enemy lines
and clearing obstacles.

00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:38.560
Master Cheng, Mr. Gu,

00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:40.800
you'll lead the Black Tortoise Unit

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:41.860
forward steadily.

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:43.040
Stay alert.

00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:45.910
The six Sword Masters will guard the rear

00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:47.110
to prevent ambushes.

00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:48.640
All units, keep pace.

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:51.260
If you're blocked, call for support.

00:31:02.910 --> 00:31:03.560
Lici,

00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:06.280
you're always trying to prove

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:07.540
you can do everything,

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:08.120
right?

00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:34.540
There's thick fog?

00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:47.350
Why is there miasma all of a sudden?

00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:49.560
Send the signal.

00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:51.520
There's miasma spreading from the north.

00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:52.780
All ships, stay close.

00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:54.690
Beware of ambushes.

00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:56.800
Message from the Falcon Unit.

00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:59.060
There's poisonous miasma approaching.

00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:05.520
Pass down the order.

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:06.670
All disciples, take your antidote.

00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:07.000
Yes.

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:23.130
Did Foxy Tang lie to me?

00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:25.040
Is this mission

00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:26.370
really that important?

00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:29.040
Why do I always feel like

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:29.830
he's doing

00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:31.890
something more important than this?

00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:33.750
The mission is complete.

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:35.440
Where's my stuff?

00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:36.960
As long as you give it to me,

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:38.160
reversing fate

00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:40.450
or turning back time won't be a problem.

00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:42.520
Qiaoyi Qiankun?

00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:43.300
How about this?

00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:45.030
I'll give you another mission.

00:32:49.630 --> 00:32:50.040
Okay.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.000
Why is he here?

00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:54.630
And why is he running errands for a kid?

00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:17.720
Everyone, be careful.

00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:19.580
We've entered the Burial Forest.

00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:34.210
What kind of flower is this?

00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:36.190
It's Bone-Soaking Lotus,

00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:37.650
grown in poisonous water.

00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:39.050
Deputy Lord Yu,

00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:41.440
tell everyone in the fleet to stay alert

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:43.300
and avoid falling into the water.

00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:50.720
What's that?

00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:06.930
The lotuses contain Man-eating Curse Bugs.

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:08.980
Stay alert!

00:34:33.250 --> 00:34:35.449
Twin Sabers front the precious shrine;

00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:39.110
Dragon gleam makes galaxies decline!

00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:02.790
The poisonous miasma has cleared.

00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:03.840
Form up and scout!

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:14.330
Send the signal!

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:15.880
Fucui,

00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:16.790
Meihua Yishu,

00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:19.040
and Kuanglan Wuxing
are stationed in the east.

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:20.320
Three rows, five columns?

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:20.960
Fucui?

00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:24.440
There are two human puppets to the east
of the Burial Forest.

00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:25.920
Send word to the fleet behind us—

00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:27.400
we'll advance on two fronts.

00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:29.100
Leopard Unit and I will continue forward.

00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:30.840
The six Sword Masters
will land with the Black Tortoise Unit

00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:32.000
from the east

00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:33.430
to engage Fucui's forces

00:35:34.110 --> 00:35:35.360
and hold his troops.

00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:54.400
The waterway ahead is blocked.

00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:04.010
I'll handle it.

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:04.180
Is that Xiuyu Peony Pavilion?

00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:05.790
Thanks to Mr. Tang.

00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:06.920
We finally found it.

00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:09.520
Yes, thanks to him.

00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:10.420
Indeed.

00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:11.040
I didn't expect

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:12.320
we'd find it so smoothly.

00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:12.710
Yes.

00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:17.000
If Fengliu Shop and the Sword Alliance

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.400
don't weaken each other,

00:37:19.050 --> 00:37:20.820
how can he, Yique Yinyang,

00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:22.480
profit from the chaos?

00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:24.140
Deputy Lord Yu,

00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:27.080
we are now deep in enemy territory.

00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:27.890
Stay focused.

00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:38.670
Master,

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:39.560
Tang Lici and the others

00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:40.690
have passed the gate

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:42.200
and are about to land.

00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:44.070
This is...

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:46.190
a trap waiting for you.

00:37:55.110 --> 00:37:57.040
Liu Yan has left Bishang Pavilion?

00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:11.230
Nineshot Arbalest?

00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:13.110
Dodge!

00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:21.200
Master, we can't get close!

00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:23.320
Spread out!

00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:25.190
Keep the geese low!

00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:26.440
Yes!

00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:29.920
Circle around the city!

00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:32.300
Follow my command!

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.840
Signalers, come with me!

00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:44.960
Master Jiang and his people encountered

00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:46.360
the Nineshot Arbalests.

00:38:50.350 --> 00:38:51.730
Liu Yan has left Bishang Pavilion.

00:38:51.730 --> 00:38:53.190
He's heading to the Six Sword Masters.

00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:53.920
Master Shao,

00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:55.910
lead the disciples to intercept Liu Yan.

00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:56.870
I will act alone.

00:38:58.710 --> 00:38:59.240
Yes!

00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:03.700
Why does he want to act alone?

00:39:19.330 --> 00:39:20.410
Everyone, stay close later.

00:39:20.410 --> 00:39:21.480
Stay fully alert.

00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:22.600
I'm going alone.

00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:27.010
What do you mean by that?

00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:31.960
Why are you going alone?

00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:34.340
To save her, of course.

00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:36.590
I'm afraid you won't come back.

00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:46.260
Deputy Lord Yu,

00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:49.220
this path is full of traps.

00:39:50.810 --> 00:39:52.250
If you're not afraid of your men

00:39:52.250 --> 00:39:52.880
dying,

00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:54.440
feel free to follow me.

00:39:59.270 --> 00:40:00.930
Disciples of Sword King City!

00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:01.880
Go quickly

00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:03.340
to reinforce Master Shao!

00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:04.880
Yes!

00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:24.540
Be careful!

00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:27.960
Tai'e Sword!

00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:29.760
The wind sweeps over the grass!

00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:37.130
Sound Killing Technique?

00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:46.830
Lotuses and duckweeds in full bloom;

00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:50.420
through shrieks and howls,
moss veils the gloom.

00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:52.180
I am Qingchan.

00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:56.860
I am Xiaohong.

00:40:57.590 --> 00:40:59.320
We're here to welcome the guest

00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:00.750
for the Master.

00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:02.230
Miss,

00:41:02.670 --> 00:41:04.040
I'm afraid you're not qualified

00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:05.000
to stop me.

00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:08.370
Kill.

00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:30.330
Not a step back?

00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:32.320
Master Shao, you really are capable.

00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:34.120
But if the Tai'e Sword is sealed,

00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:35.780
will you still be so relaxed?

00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:39.270
You really think you can seal
the Tai'e Sword

00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:40.730
with your amateur skills?

00:41:41.070 --> 00:41:42.360
You think by sealing the Tai'e Sword

00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:43.270
you can win?

00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:44.520
You really underestimated the Masters

00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:45.920
of the Central Plains Sword Alliance!
