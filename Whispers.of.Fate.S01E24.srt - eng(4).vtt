[Whispers of Fate]

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.900
[Episode 24]

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:46.640
Not a single step back?

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.640
Master Shao, you're truly skilled.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.580
But if the Tai'e Sword were sealed,

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.240
would you still be so relaxed?

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.070
With your amateur skills,

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.420
you think you can seal the Tai'e Sword?

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.759
You think by sealing the Tai'e Sword,

00:01:58.759 --> 00:01:59.680
you can win?

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:00.870
You really underestimate

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.070
the Sword Master of the Sword Alliance.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:16.870
Master Shao,

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.079
I've missed you since we parted
at Sword King City.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.430
He's walking so casually.

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.670
Is he really here to save someone?

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.970
I've been walking with you for so long

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.050
and haven't encountered any danger.

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.300
Isn't this a bit strange?

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:05.740
Do you think

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.240
we're unharmed

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:09.710
because

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.160
I'm in cahoots with the Fengliu Shop?

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:19.400
Liu Yan specializes
in curse bugs and poisons.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.030
The plants and trees here,

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.520
like the Bone-Soaking Lotus

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.980
we saw on the lake earlier,

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:25.390
appear harmless,

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:26.430
but in reality,

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.110
they contain deadly poison.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.930
Poisonous plants are potent

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.100
but predictable.

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:34.710
Meanwhile, the changes of human hearts

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:36.570
are as unfathomable as the abyss.

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.300
I've already destroyed
many poisonous flowers.

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.770
You just didn't notice.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.150
However, the poison still lingers.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.750
I suggest you take

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.079
another antidote pill.

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:00.190
I almost forgot

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.150
that you know

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.140
Yique Yinyang's strange technique,

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.540
so you don't even need it.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.480
It's Master Shao.

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.100
Finally,

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:10.680
he's here.

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:13.470
You mean

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.020
that we face the enemy directly

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.750
and win with surprise tactics?

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.480
Will Liu Yan comply?

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.170
He dared to issue a challenge,

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.000
which means he's fully prepared.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.920
And what we need to do

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.120
is to make him believe

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.890
everything is going according to his plan.

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.360
You bunch of idiots

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.520
really came to die.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.660
Shen Langhun moves swiftly.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.270
Working with the six Sword Masters,

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.720
they can handle Meihua Yishu

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:34.920
and Kuanglan Wuxing.

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.180
Master Cheng and Gu Xitan

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.090
can perfectly counter Fucui.

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:42.810
Eliminating evil
and defending righteousness...

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.180
Happens today.

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.760
Charge!

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:48.460
This way,

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.680
of Liu Yan's skilled fighters,

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.070
all that remain will be

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.950
Miss Hong,

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:53.770
Qingchan,

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:54.700
Hua Wuyan,

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:55.720
and Bai Suche.

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:56.780
What's your plan?

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.800
Liu Yan and I are evenly matched.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.510
To avoid
a direct confrontation with me,

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:02.920
he'll certainly use Ms. Zhong as bait

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:03.920
to lure me away,

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.360
then use the curse bugs to set a trap

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.120
and slaughter
the Sword Alliance's disciples.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.250
Once Liu Yan leaves Bishang Pavilion,

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.480
you will need to intercept him.

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.000
We can't let him join the main battlefield

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.310
nor allow him to return.

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:17.270
Only then will I have a chance

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:18.400
to rescue Ms. Zhong.

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:19.310
Therefore...

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:22.480
Master Shao,

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:26.770
you must use yourself as bait.

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:29.360
Tang Lici,

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.760
what exactly is going on?

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.120
All the Sword Masters are fighting,

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.450
yet you chose this path.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.920
When Master Shao encountered enemies,

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.270
you still remained indifferent.

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:39.400
You're not planning

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.240
to weaken both sides in this chaos

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.970
and eventually kill everyone,

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:44.840
like Yique Yinyang, right?

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:10.200
Green Corpse Curse Bug.

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:11.680
If this thing burrowed into

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:12.600
your brain,

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.870
trying to remove it

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:16.550
would be quite troublesome.

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.010
Deputy Lord Yu,

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:26.310
I know you have
misunderstandings about me,

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:27.840
but I still want to tell you,

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:28.830
that I

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:31.390
am not Yique Yinyang.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.570
Let's go.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:55.800
Step back.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:10.760
Tang Lici,

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:12.570
long time no see.

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:33.920
After you fought your way out,

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:34.450
did you encounter

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:35.540
anyone else?

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:39.470
Deputy Lord Yu,

00:07:40.409 --> 00:07:42.340
so this is what you've been hiding.

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:07.580
[Fallen Shisan Tower]

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.120
Such a commotion.

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:11.770
Something is definitely wrong here.

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:19.600
Chief,

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:21.890
I'm annoyed each time I come here.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.360
Coffins in cold water?

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.630
Only Gui Fusheng

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:25.390
would create

00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:26.560
such cumbersome and tedious things.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:27.680
As long as you can create

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:28.720
what I want,

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.390
the Floating Abyss is yours to use.

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:31.560
What you want

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:32.510
is almost ready.

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:33.669
Just give me a little more time.

00:08:33.669 --> 00:08:35.080
Once the Leader delivers

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:36.200
the promised Sky-Fallen Stone fragments,

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.870
I will create

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:39.630
a true miracle.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.200
The Inverted Dream

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.860
won't disappoint you, Chief.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:47.870
What's this "inverted" nonsense?

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:49.030
What weird stuff is this weirdo

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:50.000
trying to do?

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:54.390
We have a visitor.

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:12.710
You want me to personally distract Liu Yan

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:14.520
to buy you time for the rescue?

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.490
This round, Liu Yan and I

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.810
are competing for
the preemptive advantage.

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:21.130
I am fully confident.

00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:23.460
Master Shao, please rest assured.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.480
Just proceed according to the plan.

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:28.940
Master Shao,

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:30.050
long time no see.

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:31.970
Dr. Liu,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.400
thanks to your presence,

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:34.320
the people here

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.250
aren't left without medical care.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:39.510
I, Shao,

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:41.200
truly failed to recognize your status.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.650
I didn't realize

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:44.600
you're the master of Fengliu Shop.

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:46.840
It seems that it's my honor

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.020
to have you lower yourself

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:51.100
to meet me in person.

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:52.670
May I ask,

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.720
as a descendant of Zhoudi Tower,

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:56.360
why have you gone astray

00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:58.000
and committed such evil deeds?

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.610
Sword Master, stop wasting time.

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:01.330
I won't answer your question.

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:04.290
Let's see if Tang Lici comes
to save you first

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:05.640
or if you will

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:08.510
die in battle first?

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:20.750
I see now

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:23.960
that Sword King Yu
is guarding the pass for Liu Yan.

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.400
Master Shao is facing Liu Yan already.

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:29.660
I need to make it quick.

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:49.830
Go save Ms. Zhong first.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:57.200
Hurry!

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:01.340
Mofeng Black Fire.

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:04.150
Phoenix's Bloody Tears.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.980
Ten Blazing Suns, Lotuses Bloom!

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:13.540
Neither truly dead nor alive,

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:15.600
why live such a miserable existence?

00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:26.870
Don't tell me

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:28.250
that after the battle in Biluo Palace,

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:29.830
you actually believed his disguise.

00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:31.160
Doing bad things

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:33.670
doesn't make you a bad person,

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:36.390
as long as you're not caught.

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.050
Don't let your life

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:39.770
and Sword King City's century-old legacy

00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:42.100
become the price of your misplaced trust!

00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:53.350
Tang Lici,

00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:55.530
you're indeed a monster.

00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:57.300
Yu Qifeng.

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:00.890
I can kill you right now.

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:18.540
Of course you can kill me.

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:19.720
Today,

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.480
I've already trapped
the Sword Alliance here.

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.390
Tomorrow, I'll storm into Sword King City,

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:25.590
invade Biluo Palace,

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:27.360
and turn the entire jianghu

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.080
into a river of blood!

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:35.240
and release

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:37.750
the followers who were imprisoned
on Camellia Island

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:39.550
They've waited for so many years

00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:41.370
and can finally welcome back...

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:45.630
Yique Yinyang.

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:48.250
Follow and live, or resist and die,

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:50.320
just like over 10 years ago.

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:54.200
He is my enemy.

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:08.370
Since that's what you believe,

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:10.380
I'll help make your dream come true.

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:41.990

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:44.440
You really are Yique Yinyang.

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:46.480
Are Biluo Palace and the Sword Alliance

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:47.030
all just

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:49.160
your excuses to yield in order to gain?

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:52.030
Furen,

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:54.030
you're truly my good son.

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.080
I will kill Yique Yinyang right now

00:13:57.390 --> 00:13:59.660
to honor your heroic sacrifice.

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:07.590
Father, you actually want to kill me?

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:13.090
Do you see now?

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:15.690
He's the one who's been
using you all along.

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:21.600
Draw your sword.

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:23.090
Tang Lici.

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:24.520
Draw your sword.

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:42.750
My son, why are you drawing your sword?

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:45.320
You believe Yique Yinyang

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:46.670
but not your own father?

00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:48.240
You're not my father at all!

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:56.240
Die!

00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:59.390
In our next life, we'll be enemies,
not father and son!

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:15.150
Acting on impulse

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:16.810
nearly ruined everything.

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:24.550
That voice...

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:28.150
How may I address you?

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:31.720
Ghostly Peony.

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:44.960
I'm sorry.

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:52.100
You should rest and recover here,

00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:53.450
and await assistance.

00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:58.920
Yu Qifeng has delayed me for too long.

00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:00.650
I'll go rescue Ms. Zhong first.

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:17.030
I wonder how Mr. Tang

00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:18.440
and the others are doing.

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:23.200
Stone!

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:25.000
Stone, are you alright?

00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:27.170
I have a feeling

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:27.980
that Master

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:29.360
is in danger.

00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:06.380
There are traps here.

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:16.089
There's poison!

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:23.480
This formation has been activated.

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:24.869
Everything within its reach

00:17:24.869 --> 00:17:27.130
becomes territory for my Martial Realm.

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:33.590
Drawing boundaries to create a prison,

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:35.120
trapping oneself in a cage.

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:36.790
Is Liu Yan always

00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:38.550
so self-pitying like this?

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:39.690
Master ordered me

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:41.340
to delay you for a moment.

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:43.680
You think you can trap me

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:45.550
with just this cage and smoke?

00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:46.510
Mr. Tang,

00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:48.630
don't underestimate this cage.

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:50.240
Once you leave

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:50.960
this cage,

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:53.170
Ms. Zhong will be in grave danger.

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:56.160
Moreover,

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:57.480
Master has also

00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:58.790
left something for me.

00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:03.200
This item is called
the Moon in Water Mirror.

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:04.960
It not only reveals

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:05.890
all your actions

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:07.640
but also allows you to witness

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:10.370
how Fengliu Shop slaughters
the Sword Alliance.

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:11.510
However, Mr. Tang

00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:13.040
and Ms. Zhong, don't worry.

00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:15.750
The place where you are now
is perfectly safe.

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:17.610
Just wait until they're all dead,

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:19.970
then come out to collect their bodies.

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:26.350

that I've lived my entire life wrong?

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:46.800
♪ I cross the Yan River in the wasteland ♪

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:48.410
If heaven

00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:51.550
would give me
another chance to start over,

00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:52.470
♪ Singing a long, unfinished song ♪

00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:55.430
I would never
let myself be abandoned again.

00:23:57.650 --> 00:24:00.910
♪ The full moon and a few shining stars ♪

00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:02.800
Your destiny shows weak family bonds

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:03.700
♪ Look down on my dream ♪

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:05.180
and no power or wealth.

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:07.520
What others are born with,

00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:08.940
you must fight desperately to obtain—

00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:10.770
only then might you stand a slim chance
of getting it.

00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:12.770
If you miss just one opportunity,

00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:14.070
you'll lose everything.

00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:15.750
♪ The breeze blows through the pleats ♪

00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:17.110
In your heart,

00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:19.610
there's also a monster.

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:21.310
And you, Ms. Zhong,

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:23.400
are still putting on a facade.

00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:24.920
But if I were you,

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:26.040
with such a fate,

00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:26.160
♪ Water polishes the old ruts ♪

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:27.000
I would contentedly

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.590
be an ordinary disciple

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:30.440
Why struggle for more?

00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:33.560
What if I insist on struggling?

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:34.480
Ms. Zhong,

00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:37.110
you are just an ordinary person.

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:39.090
Why do you hold yourself

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:40.640
to the standards of a saint?

00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:42.840
I want to

00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:47.040
become the master of my own fate.

00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:26.830

Green Corpse Curse Bug?

00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:35.790
If this thing burrowed into

00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:36.650
your brain,

00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:38.350
trying to remove it

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:40.190
would be quite troublesome.

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:41.200
Tang Lici.

00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:42.520
Draw your sword.

00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:44.290
Why did you protect me?

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:46.400
What's the truth?

00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:50.090
Weren't you told to wait for assistance?

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:52.530
You should rest and recover here,

00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:53.790
and await assistance.

00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:56.300
Stop spacing out. Follow me.

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:18.040
Master Shao,

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:19.640
it seems you won't last

00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:20.970
until Mr. Tang arrives.

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:26.270
Who says my body is failing?

00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:32.510
Master Shao!

00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:35.420
Master Shao!

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:36.330
Are you alright?

00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:37.060
Master Shao!

00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:42.100
A few more of you
won't make any difference.

00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:43.420
Come on if you dare!

00:27:51.650 --> 00:27:52.780
It's blood.

00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:59.310
This is Hua Wuyan's blood.

00:28:00.910 --> 00:28:02.040
He died,

00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:05.750
but his death

00:28:05.890 --> 00:28:07.930
will bring you all a great gift.

00:28:13.170 --> 00:28:15.430
The formation eye mark left by Tang Lici.

00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:34.580
Search for the mark.

00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:35.440
-Hurry.
-Okay.

00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:05.030
Pu,

00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:06.960
your antidote pills
aren't working anymore.

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:07.840
How would I know

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:09.790
this thing could mutate?

00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:20.810
Everyone, hold on!

00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:23.920
The Peony Pavilion

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:24.960
means nothing to me.

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:26.560
It's no matter to abandon it.

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:31.240
But you nobodies...

00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:33.000
None of you will escape

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.130
from under my watch!

00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:35.720
If I release all the power

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:36.780
of the Tai'e Sword,

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:38.550
I can surely defeat Liu Yan.

00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:41.240
Since the situation can't be reversed,

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:43.960
we should at least
make this demon die with us.

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:54.790
Stars in the vast cosmos,

00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:56.760
the mystery of mysteries!

00:29:57.960 --> 00:29:59.720
Illuminating the dark night,

00:30:00.410 --> 00:30:02.390
bringing order to the heavens.

00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:07.810
Reflecting upon mountains
and rivers as protection.

00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:10.430
All living beings,

00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:13.440
forever in our hearts.

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:18.210
Biluo Palace returning to Luo River

00:30:18.210 --> 00:30:19.940
was thanks to your assistance.

00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:21.720
If trouble befalls the jianghu,

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:22.200
Biluo Palace

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:24.110
can lend the Celestial Thunder Technique

00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:26.270
to help the Sword Alliance
achieve victory.

00:30:26.270 --> 00:30:27.330
Palace Chief Wanyu

00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:28.890
is counting on you.

00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:30.710
Poison spreads everywhere.

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:32.800
Heaven's virtue is lost.

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:38.200
I, who worship the stars,

00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:41.850
Wanyu Yuedan...

00:30:51.790 --> 00:30:54.390
Sincerely perform this dance
to ward off evil,

00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:58.820
borrowing the spirits of heaven and earth.

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:13.810
May the Thunder God clear the path,

00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:16.870
and bring rain to eliminate disaster!

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.260
Consecrate the sword!

00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:44.950
Liu Yan,

00:31:45.610 --> 00:31:47.540
you have already lost this battle.

00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:50.480
You can abandon the Peony Pavilion.

00:31:50.790 --> 00:31:52.520
You can abandon your comrades.

00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:54.960
You can also easily abandon

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:56.510
the righteous path taught by Fang Zhou.

00:31:56.510 --> 00:31:58.410
But I will never abandon

00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:00.440
any disciple of the Sword Alliance.

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:02.680
I swore on the Tai'e Sword

00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:03.800
to protect

00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:05.350
the lives of all disciples.

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:07.000
I will personally cut off

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.240
your demonic head.

00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:09.920
Even if I have to die for this,

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:11.320
fighting for justice...

00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:14.750
What is there to fear?

00:32:20.490 --> 00:32:21.730
If we were elsewhere,

00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:22.880
I would probably

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:24.340
have died under that move.

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:26.930
But since I lured you here,

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.880
I'm obviously prepared.

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:29.480
This is

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:31.160
the Ice Flower curse bug
that I prepared

00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:32.290
for the Tai'e Sword.

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:33.750
Combining the power of three,

00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:35.110
I waited specifically
for the moment of sword consecration

00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:36.030
to control you

00:32:36.050 --> 00:32:37.420
and show you

00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:39.370
what true despair really is.

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:41.130
Master Shao,

00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:43.750
if there were
true righteousness in this world,

00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:45.680
how could Fang Zhou have perished?

00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:54.950
Master Shao!

00:32:57.920 --> 00:32:58.750
Master!

00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:12.870
Master!

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:17.750
Chunji,

00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:19.550
I'm glad you're back.

00:33:19.770 --> 00:33:21.370
I'm glad you're back.

00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:25.120
Liu Yan,

00:33:25.650 --> 00:33:27.310
Hua Wuyan died because of you.

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:29.720
How many more times

00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:31.950
will you repeat such needless sacrifices?

00:33:31.950 --> 00:33:34.080
Those words should be directed at you.

00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:35.680
I'm curious to know

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:37.000
how many more heroes

00:33:37.030 --> 00:33:38.560
you'll send to their deaths

00:33:39.090 --> 00:33:40.950
at the Peony Pavilion to save Ms. Zhong.

00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:41.470
You...

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:42.350
Chunji.

00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:44.270
Chunji.

00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:46.420
Chunji!

00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:53.500
Besides such clumsy provocations,

00:33:53.510 --> 00:33:54.670
what else can you do?

00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:57.480
Clumsy?

00:33:58.030 --> 00:33:59.350
Could it be clumsier

00:33:59.350 --> 00:34:01.000
than the lies you told me at Biluo Palace?

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.420
I've been to Zhoudi Tower.

00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:04.280
There was clearly nothing there!

00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:09.340
In that case,

00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:11.820
I'll capture you first

00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:14.170
and then explain everything clearly.

00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:48.510
You often use that innocent face

00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:49.760
to deceive people

00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:51.659
who believe your nonsense.

00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:53.909
None of you are innocent.

00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:03.550
You always think

00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:04.840
you can do anything.

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:06.110
The Sword Alliance

00:35:06.810 --> 00:35:09.010
was ruined because of your confidence.

00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:11.140
Master Jiang,

00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:12.110
all the curse bugs

00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:13.440
are attacking Mr. Tang.

00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:16.520
Follow Mr. Tang's orders.

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:18.800
Notify the Mole Camp

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:19.960
to light the fire!

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:20.740
Liu Yan,

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:22.440
you've used all your backup plans

00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:23.590
to attack me.

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:26.420
You've already used up
all your trump cards.

00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:28.920
The endgame has arrived.

00:35:29.550 --> 00:35:30.880
This is what I mean by...

00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:34.270
"giving back in twofold"

00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:10.550
Tang Lici,

00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:12.590
the Peony Pavilion is yours now.

00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:14.370
I wonder when we meet again,

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:15.920
what kind of person

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:17.070
you will become.

00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:38.360
Great!

00:37:03.410 --> 00:37:04.500
Look at what's written here.

00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:05.060
Look!

00:37:05.090 --> 00:37:06.640
The Peony Pavilion has fallen!

00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:08.370
The Peony Pavilion has fallen!

00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:09.360
We've won!

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:10.150
Victory!

00:37:13.870 --> 00:37:17.000
Zhong Chunji, the heroine
and Chief of Shanfeng Branch,

00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:17.710
all of this

00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:19.230
was given to you by him.

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:19.960
Not a single thing

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:21.630
truly belongs to you.

00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:23.000
That's why you fight so hard

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:23.880
to defend him.

00:37:24.190 --> 00:37:26.190
It's because you know that, without him,

00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:27.630
you are nothing.

00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:30.180
If you think I'm so worthless,

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.560
then why waste your breath?

00:37:32.590 --> 00:37:33.760
Kill me already!

00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:35.800
In your heart,

00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:38.070
there's also a monster.

00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:00.070
This attack on Fengliu Shop

00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:01.590
cost many lives.

00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:03.280
It's because Senior Zhong
was too eager for merit

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:04.590
and acted without following orders.

00:38:04.590 --> 00:38:05.500
Don't say that.

00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:06.360
It was always the plan

00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:07.360
to attack Fengliu Shop.

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:08.880
Sooner or later, we had to attack anyway.

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:11.140
It's not good if someone overhears this.

00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:16.750
I really want to know

00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:17.960
how many more heroes

00:38:18.110 --> 00:38:19.860
you'll send to their deaths

00:38:19.890 --> 00:38:22.090
at the Peony Pavilion to save Ms. Zhong.

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:33.590
Who is it?

00:38:35.590 --> 00:38:36.400
Ms. Zhong,

00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:37.280
it's me.

00:38:43.710 --> 00:38:44.760
Where is Mr. Tang?

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:47.080
Where is my Master?

00:38:48.990 --> 00:38:50.790
They're talking in Wanhua Hall.

00:38:54.110 --> 00:38:55.230
Why are you up?

00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:57.110
You need to rest more.

00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:11.170
Ms. Zhong,

00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:13.910
you've suffered so much.

00:39:15.730 --> 00:39:16.730
It's alright now.

00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:19.810
When I was in Yanxian,

00:39:20.590 --> 00:39:22.590
I was also imprisoned and tortured.

00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:26.500
You were the one who saved me.

00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:28.090
That feeling of despair

00:39:28.410 --> 00:39:29.670
was truly unbearable.

00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:32.880
Thankfully,

00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:35.760
we're both safe now.

00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:37.440
By the way,

00:39:37.850 --> 00:39:39.450
while you were unconscious,

00:39:39.470 --> 00:39:40.510
Mr. Tang came to examine

00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:41.590
your injuries.

00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:44.250
They're just some surface wounds.

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:48.740
This is the medicine he provided.

00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:51.950
As long as you take it regularly,

00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:53.480
you'll recover soon.

00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:57.800
Everything will be fine.

00:40:04.810 --> 00:40:05.730
Thank you,

00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:07.610
Shei.

00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:14.150
Master Jiang,

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:16.840
you'll be responsible
for arranging guards to patrol

00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:19.100
and secure the perimeter of Mount Cloud.

00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:20.360
As for distributing medication

00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:22.110
and taking care of the wounded,

00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:24.560
Master Ji will be in charge of that.

00:40:25.410 --> 00:40:27.670
-We will do our best.
-We will do our best.

00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:30.280
Mr. Tang,

00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:32.960
I had many misgivings
about you before.

00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:33.960
I feel ashamed.

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:36.220
This battle at Peony Pavilion...

00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:39.290
I understand.

00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:41.960
No need to worry, Master Jiang.

00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:52.250
Hold it in.

00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:55.470
It would be embarrassing
if we both coughed up blood here.

00:40:55.470 --> 00:40:57.290
The Sword Alliance is a complex group.

00:40:57.290 --> 00:40:58.950
Now, all branches are united.

00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:00.600
It's truly a feat.

00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:03.540
Thank you for your help,
Palace Chief Wanyu.

00:41:03.630 --> 00:41:04.830
If it weren't for you,

00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:08.030
the Sword Alliance would have
suffered greater losses.

00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:08.960
As allies,

00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:10.950
helping each other is expected.

00:41:11.230 --> 00:41:12.190
It's a pity we couldn't

00:41:12.190 --> 00:41:13.700
eliminate them completely.

00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:14.630
We searched the entire Peony Pavilion

00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:15.230
but couldn't find

00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:16.000
the whereabouts

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.600
of Liu Yan and other key figures.

00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:18.400
However, blowing up

00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:20.130
the entire Peony Pavilion base

00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:22.360
and forcing Liu Yan to abandon his hideout

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:23.440
has boosted morale,

00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:25.550
so it wasn't a complete waste.

00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:26.900
Indeed.

00:41:27.230 --> 00:41:28.550
But Master Puzhu

00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:30.410
still hasn't sent any news.

00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:32.400
I wonder if he's safe.

00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:39.840
Looking at it like this,

00:41:41.230 --> 00:41:42.630
the world seems so small.

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:45.580
But after staring for a while,

00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:48.840
this tiny night sky

00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:51.330
feels like a vortex.

00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:53.910
It keeps spinning,

00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:56.710
pulling people in.

00:41:58.520 --> 00:41:59.690
If we died here,

00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:04.020
would it count as dying together?

00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:08.330
Miss Tao,

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:10.790
why did you join Fengliu Shop?
