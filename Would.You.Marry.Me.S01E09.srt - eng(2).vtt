[Kim Wooju] It looks like they managed
the local subcontractors, too.

All our money went through them.

00:10:10.506 --> 00:10:14.219
Most of the subcontractors are
shell companies that exist in name only.

I'd like you to look into it

You skipped lunch,

It's just that I didn't sleep well.

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:47.413

[Wooju] He's the grandson

What if word were to get out
that the heir had a fling

00:13:10.812 --> 00:13:13.606
with a married woman
and pretended to be her husband?

00:13:13.689 --> 00:13:15.775
Not only will he not inherit the company,

00:13:15.858 --> 00:13:17.860
I bet he'll have to leave the country.

00:13:18.486 --> 00:13:20.196
He'll be branded forever...

[Eungsoo] There are three surefire ways
to win a woman's heart.

00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:08.536
If she's upset or you need to make up
for a misunderstanding,

00:14:08.619 --> 00:14:10.079
this is incredibly effective.

00:14:10.705 --> 00:14:14.876
Then you can use this strategy
even after she becomes your girlfriend?

00:14:14.959 --> 00:14:16.002
You bet.

00:14:16.961 --> 00:14:18.171
Number one.

00:14:18.254 --> 00:14:20.590
It must be a feast for the eyes.

-[Eungsoo] Right.

What should you do, then?

00:14:23.843 --> 00:14:26.304
Take her to a place
that will make her eyes pop open.

00:14:26.387 --> 00:14:27.889
[Wonseok] Such as...

00:14:27.972 --> 00:14:30.766

to take photos at such a place?

[Wonseok laughing] You can't.

00:14:42.695 --> 00:14:45.198

00:14:45.281 --> 00:14:48.284
I don't usually share
these things with anyone,

00:14:48.367 --> 00:14:51.746
but I will especially for you, Mr. Han.

00:14:51.829 --> 00:14:55.291

When a woman speaks less
or is annoyed for no reason,

feed her something.

No matter how full they are,
they can keep on eating.

Okay.

00:15:37.291 --> 00:15:41.879
The last one could be
the watershed moment.

00:15:41.963 --> 00:15:43.172
The last point.

someone would betray me.

She might announce that Wooju's her heir

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:57.718
And why would you argue with an elder?

00:19:57.802 --> 00:19:59.845
What if she faints or something?

00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:03.224
She keeps aggravating me.

00:20:04.767 --> 00:20:06.018
Don't let it get to you.

00:20:06.602 --> 00:20:09.021
I'm more worried about how you feel.

00:20:09.647 --> 00:20:10.856
I'll be home soon.

00:20:12.358 --> 00:20:13.484

Aren't you being too sweet
when you'll leave her soon?

00:20:29.041 --> 00:20:30.042
Are you jealous?

00:20:30.125 --> 00:20:33.587
[scoffs] More like a hint of suspicion?

00:20:35.673 --> 00:20:39.009
You act out of character sometimes
when you talk to her,

00:20:39.093 --> 00:20:40.094
and it's confusing.

00:20:40.177 --> 00:20:41.178
That's impossible.

00:20:41.887 --> 00:20:43.097
Don't mind her.

00:20:43.556 --> 00:20:45.558
I can't do that if you don't cooperate.

00:20:47.268 --> 00:20:49.812
Will you divorce her when you go back?

00:20:49.895 --> 00:20:52.439
I told you it's not yet time.

00:20:52.523 --> 00:20:53.774
Do it right away.

00:20:55.568 --> 00:20:56.569
Get a divorce.

00:20:56.652 --> 00:20:58.195
What got into you now?

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:00.990
You managed to wait this long.

You can't take Henry to a mall

No.

Okay, I get you.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry I wasn't considerate.

Very soon, we'll have all we dreamed of.

because you can keep a secret, right?

You should sit.

You've been down
ever since we visited my grandma.

Was it...

00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:24.878
because of what she said?

00:25:27.756 --> 00:25:30.884
That's just her old business philosophy.

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:33.178
She didn't say that to spite you,

00:25:34.513 --> 00:25:37.349
and you were cornered
due to your circumstances.

00:25:38.308 --> 00:25:39.852
I'll talk to her for you.

to see him go down!

doesn't have a sob story?

But not everyone scams others like you.

back then but not anymore...

00:56:57.394 --> 00:56:58.395
[chuckles]

00:57:02.190 --> 00:57:03.400
Chairwoman.

00:57:03.483 --> 00:57:05.402
-[Philnyun] Oh, hi.
-Hello.

00:57:05.485 --> 00:57:06.611
Hello, Ms. Yoo.

00:57:06.695 --> 00:57:08.488
Congratulations on the anniversary.

00:57:08.572 --> 00:57:09.614
Thank you.

00:57:10.073 --> 00:57:11.450
Take her to her seat, Mr. Kim.

00:57:11.533 --> 00:57:12.701
Yes, of course.

00:57:13.160 --> 00:57:14.244
But...

00:57:16.037 --> 00:57:17.956
-About what I said before--
-[Juhee] Chairwoman.

00:57:18.039 --> 00:57:19.541
The undersecretary is here.

00:57:19.624 --> 00:57:20.667
[Philnyun] Okay.

00:57:29.342 --> 00:57:31.386
[chuckles softly] Shall we talk later?

00:57:32.387 --> 00:57:33.388
Yes.

00:57:37.392 --> 00:57:38.685
[Philnyun] Thanks for coming.

00:57:39.269 --> 00:57:40.687
-Thank you.
-Let's go inside.

00:57:42.856 --> 00:57:45.317
[Sejung] Park Jaegwan,
Quality Management Team.

00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:46.651
[♪ upbeat, whimsical music playing]

00:57:46.735 --> 00:57:48.737
Gang Giseong, Design Team.

00:57:49.321 --> 00:57:51.740
Han Wonseok, Marketing Team.

00:57:53.366 --> 00:57:54.618
Thank you!

00:57:54.701 --> 00:57:57.662
[Sejung] Kim Jingyu,
Research and Development Team.

00:57:57.746 --> 00:58:01.958
Nine people were awarded the long-term
service award for their ten-year tenure.

00:58:02.042 --> 00:58:04.169
Please give them some warm applause.

00:58:09.257 --> 00:58:10.258
EXECUTIVES

00:58:19.559 --> 00:58:23.480
Now, Chairwoman Ko Philnyun
will give a speech.

00:58:24.564 --> 00:58:26.817
Please give her a warm welcome.

00:58:26.900 --> 00:58:28.276
[all applauding, cheering]

00:58:43.166 --> 00:58:44.334
[grunts]

00:58:51.132 --> 00:58:52.634
Eighty years...

00:58:54.135 --> 00:58:56.972
is long enough for our surroundings
to change many times.

00:58:57.055 --> 00:58:59.099
Over that long time,

00:58:59.182 --> 00:59:04.145
our Myungsoondang has been through
many changes and ups and downs.

00:59:05.605 --> 00:59:06.606
LEE SUNGWOO

00:59:06.690 --> 00:59:08.817
If there's one thing that doesn't change,

00:59:09.651 --> 00:59:10.694
that would be...

00:59:11.194 --> 00:59:13.989
-Hello?
-...the spirit of care and sharing.

00:59:14.072 --> 00:59:15.156
That's great to hear.

00:59:15.240 --> 00:59:19.411
-I hope to see you soon. Bye.
-I learned from my late mother-in-law

00:59:19.494 --> 00:59:22.330
-the spirit of care and sharing.
-[line ringing]

00:59:22.414 --> 00:59:25.333
-Set up two more seats at the VIP table...
-My mother-in-law

00:59:25.417 --> 00:59:28.003
-[Hangu] ...for Beauté's people.
-[Philnyun] left me a great legacy.

00:59:28.086 --> 00:59:32.549
I clung to that spirit,
and it brought us this far.

00:59:33.174 --> 00:59:36.553
I believe that's why
you shower us with your love.

00:59:36.887 --> 00:59:37.888
[phone vibrates]

00:59:37.971 --> 00:59:40.515
In the future, we must take this spirit...

00:59:40.599 --> 00:59:43.435
[Kim Wooju] Ms. Yoo,
Mr. Baek is on his way here.

00:59:43.518 --> 00:59:45.103
[Philnyun] Not forgetting that

00:59:45.186 --> 00:59:48.315
is the way to repay you
for your appreciation.

00:59:49.441 --> 00:59:53.612
I thank you again for sparing
your precious time to join us.

00:59:53.695 --> 00:59:55.196
[guests cheering, applauding]

00:59:57.115 --> 00:59:59.409
What happened?
You said they couldn't come.

00:59:59.492 --> 01:00:01.661
Their business trip got cut short.

01:00:02.287 --> 01:00:03.330
What should we do?

01:00:03.413 --> 01:00:07.167
Well, we decided to come clean.
Why don't we just do that today?

01:00:07.792 --> 01:00:10.670
We should tell the chairwoman first.

01:00:10.754 --> 01:00:13.006
It's not right
to let her hear it from Mr. Baek.

01:00:13.548 --> 01:00:14.883
What do we do, then?

01:00:15.425 --> 01:00:18.720
I think we should avoid
crossing paths with Mr. Baek.

01:00:18.803 --> 01:00:20.472
Only until we tell the chairwoman.

01:00:21.097 --> 01:00:22.182
Let's do that.

01:00:22.265 --> 01:00:23.767
Go ahead. I'll say goodbye first.

01:00:24.935 --> 01:00:26.728
[♪ gripping, whimsical music playing]

01:01:04.015 --> 01:01:06.559
-[guest] You look amazing.
-[Philnyun chuckles] Thank you.

01:01:12.315 --> 01:01:14.943
-Hello.
-Are you going somewhere?

01:01:16.027 --> 01:01:20.281
I need to be somewhere. I'm so sorry.

01:01:20.365 --> 01:01:21.658
Okay.

01:01:22.409 --> 01:01:24.494
I was hoping to speak with you.

01:01:25.954 --> 01:01:29.040
Are you personally close to my Wooju?

01:01:31.001 --> 01:01:32.043
[hesitating]

01:01:33.003 --> 01:01:34.129
Yes.

01:01:34.879 --> 01:01:38.174
Team Manager Kim Wooju is my grandson.
You know that, right?

01:01:38.758 --> 01:01:40.135
[Meri] Yes, I know.

01:01:40.218 --> 01:01:43.513
[Philnyun] If you're busy today,
you should visit me at home one day.

01:01:46.725 --> 01:01:47.809
[chuckles softly]

01:01:53.982 --> 01:01:55.025
[chuckles softly]

01:02:12.792 --> 01:02:14.544
[♪ tense, foreboding music playing]

01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:29.976
[line ringing]

01:02:30.435 --> 01:02:31.519
Yes, sir.

01:02:32.103 --> 01:02:35.148
I think I can secure a unit
for the mayor of Yongdu soon.

01:02:35.648 --> 01:02:38.860
I may be able to retrieve the house
that was lost through the raffle.

01:02:43.698 --> 01:02:45.075
[♪ music crescendos, fades]

01:02:52.207 --> 01:02:53.333
Mr. Baek.

01:02:57.253 --> 01:02:59.798
Thank you so much for coming.

01:03:00.215 --> 01:03:01.841
Come on in.

01:03:01.925 --> 01:03:02.926
Mr. Kim.

01:03:03.468 --> 01:03:05.220
What's your relationship with Ms. Yoo?

01:03:06.971 --> 01:03:09.516
Are you two really married?

01:03:09.599 --> 01:03:11.184
[♪ tense, foreboding music playing]

01:03:11.267 --> 01:03:12.352
[hesitates]

01:03:23.404 --> 01:03:24.405
[hesitates]

01:03:35.083 --> 01:03:36.668
[♪ gentle pop music playing]

01:03:44.134 --> 01:03:46.761
THANKS TO KIM YOUNGJAE
FOR THE SPECIAL APPEARANCE

01:04:01.901 --> 01:04:04.904
WOULD YOU MARRY ME?

01:04:04.988 --> 01:04:07.323
[Sanghyeon] If not married,
the prize will be revoked.

01:04:07.407 --> 01:04:09.200
[Jingyeong] I'm left with no choice, then.

01:04:09.284 --> 01:04:10.577
I have no choice but to reveal.

01:04:10.660 --> 01:04:14.122
[Meri] If someone gives you a hard time,
I won't stand for it.

01:04:14.205 --> 01:04:15.999
[Juhee] The chairwoman
probably didn't know

01:04:16.291 --> 01:04:18.543
that the contract with the Kaltz was fake.

01:04:18.626 --> 01:04:20.837
[Meri] This person...
She said her name was Jessica.

01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:22.672
[Eungsoo] Grandma woke up?

01:04:22.755 --> 01:04:24.174
[Kim Wooju] It's all over now.

01:04:24.966 --> 01:04:27.010
Grandma, I'm afraid.

01:04:27.635 --> 01:04:29.304
I'm afraid that you were right.

01:04:30.013 --> 01:04:31.014
Was it you, Uncle?

01:04:31.097 --> 01:04:32.182
[exclaims in frustration]

01:04:33.224 --> 01:04:34.601
[Kim Wooju] Was it you?
